From time to time the order takers cannot cope with the number of incoming calls, and then customers grow impatient and hang up the phone without placing an order.</p><p>For getting a quick impression, you can <a href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/Core2/Make-and-Deliver-Pizza-1/">run this model</a> from the OES GitHub website, or inspect its <a href="https://github.com/gwagner57/oes/tree/master/docs/js/Core2/Make-and-Deliver-Pizza-1">OESjs code</a>. </p><p>Since there is a high number of lost orders due to long waiting times in the first model, assigning different responsibilities to organizational roles for allowing a more flexible use of human resources is considered in a variant of the first model.</p><blockquote class="role-note"><p>Our <em>Make-and-Deliver-Pizza</em> modeling problem is based on the chapter &quot;Example Model 3: Pizzeria operation&quot; in the book <a href="https://www.anylogic.com/resources/books/the-art-of-process-centric-modeling-with-anylogic/">The Art of Process-Centric Modeling with AnyLogic</a> by Arash Mahdavi.</p></blockquote><details open="open"><summary>Conceptual Model</summary><p>A pizza service company has resource pools for order takers, pizza makers, pizza ovens, delivery staff and scooters. While <em>take order</em> activities are performed by an <em>order taker</em>, <em>make pizza</em> activities require both an <em>oven</em> and a <em>pizza maker</em>. Finally, <i><em>deliver</em> pizza</i> activities require a delivery staff member and a scooter.</p><details open="open"><summary>Conceptual Information Model</summary><p>The potentially relevant object types are:</p><ol><li>pizza service company,</li><li>customers,</li><li>orders,</li><li>pizzas,</li><li>order takers,</li><li>pizza makers,</li><li>pizza ovens</li><li>delivery scooter drivers,</li><li>scooters.</li></ol><p>Potentially relevant types of events and activities are:</p><ol><li>pizza ordering calls coming in from customers,</li><li>order taking (an activity performed by order takers),</li><li>customers hanging up the phone when having to wait for too long,</li><li>pizza making (performed by pizza makers using ovens),</li><li>pizza delivery (performed by delivery staff using scooters).</li></ol><p>Object, event and activity types, together with their participation associations, can be visually described in a conceptual information model in the form of a special kind of UML class diagram, called Object Event (<abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr>) class diagram, as shown below.</p><figure><img alt="conceptual information model describing object, event and activity types" src="_res/Pizzeria_CIMa.svg" width="450" /></figure><p>The association end annotations «rr» and «rp» denote <em>resource roles</em> and <em>resource pools</em>. For instance, the activity type <i>make pizza</i> has two resource roles, <i>pizza maker</i>s and <i>oven</i>. A pizza service company has resource pools for order takers, pizza makers, ovens, delivery scooter drivers and scooters. </p><p>Resource roles have resource cardinality constraints. For instance, a <i>make pizza</i> activity requires 2 pizza makers and 1 oven.</p><p>A conceptual <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class diagram like the one above, describes resource roles (like <i>oven</i>), resource role types (like <i>ovens</i>) and resource cardinality constraints (like &quot;exactly 1&quot;) for all types of activities. </p><p>An organization defines <em>organizational positions</em>, which are filled by human resources. Each organizational position is characterized by a set of human resource roles to be played by position holders. In the Pizza Service organization, there are three positions: order takers, pizza makers and delivery scooter drivers.</p><blockquote class="role-attention"><p>Strictly speaking, <i>order phone calls</i> are immediate (zero duration) events while a <i>take order</i> activity is an event with a non-zero duration. For simplicity, though, we'll often say &quot;events&quot; instead of &quot;immediate events&quot; or &quot;objects, events and activities&quot; instead of &quot;objects, immediate events and activities&quot;.</p></blockquote></details><details open="open"><summary>Conceptual Process Model</summary><p>The following BPMN diagram shows a conceptual process model of the Make-and-Deliver-Pizza business process, with three swimlanes for the three performers of the process:</p><figure><img alt="A conceptual process model in the form of a BPMN diagram" src="_res/Pizzeria_CPM_BPMN-2.svg" width="500" /></figure><p>Notice the BPMN Boundary Timeout Event circle attached to the <i>take order</i> activity representing timeout events that cancel the activity. They are supposed to model the <em>reneging</em> behavior of waiting customers loosing their patience and hanging up the phone without placing an order. However, BPMN does not allow restricting such a timeout mechanism to the waiting phase of a planned activity, that is the time span during which the planned activity has been enqueued, but not yet started. Rather, it applies to the entire cycle time of <i>take order</i> activities, which means that also started activities, where the order taker is already listening to the customer, may be canceled due to reneging.</p><p>While BPMN allows modeling the performers of activities with swimlanes, it does not support modeling other types of resource objects. As a workaround, we have included the resource objects <i>oven</i>s and <i>scooter</i>s in the form of BPMN Data Objects.</p><p>The third, and most severe, issue of the BPMN model is its uniform (semantically overloaded) use of &quot;sequence flow&quot; arrows for sequencing events and activities. While in the case of all three activities, incoming &quot;sequence flow&quot; arrows do not mean that an activity is started, but rather that a new planned activity is enqueued (and only started when all required resources become available), in the case of the event <i>lost order</i>, the incoming &quot;sequence flow&quot; arrow means that a new event is scheduled to occur immediately.</p><p>These three issues of BPMN have been solved in DPMN, where <em>resource-dependent activity start arrows</em> are distinguished from <em>event scheduling arrows</em>, as shown in the following DPMN process diagram:</p><figure><img alt="A conceptual process model in the form of a DPMN diagram" src="_res/Pizzeria_CPM-2.svg" width="500" /></figure><p>Notice how the timeout event circle (with a clock icon) is attached to the three bars of the resource-dependent activity start arrow representing the queue of planned order taking activities waiting for the availability of an order taker. This implies that the timeout applies to the waiting phase, and not to the order taking activity.</p><p>A conceptual <abbr title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process diagram does normally not include any element representing a resource pool. Yet, it may display the performer roles of activity types, like <i>order taker</i> and <i>pizza maker </i> in the diagram above. It is assumed that for any organizational position described in the underlying <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class model, the organization under consideration has a corresponding resource pool.</p></details></details><details open="open"><summary>Simulation Design</summary><p>In our simulation design, we make the following simplifications. We consider only one particular pizza service company, which does not have to be modeled as an explicit object. Also, we abstract away from individual customers, orders and pizzas. And we merge the resource roles <i>delivery scooter driver</i> and <i>scooter</i>, keeping only <i>scooter</i>s as resources of <i>deliver pizza</i> activities.</p><p>We consider a scenario with two order takers, ten pizza makers, five ovens and 20 scooters.</p><details open="open"><summary>Information Design Model</summary><p>An information design model, in the form of an <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class diagram as shown below, is derived from a conceptual information model by </p><ol><li>Abstracting away from items that are not design-relevant.</li><li>Adding properties,functions and methods to object, event and activity classes. In particular, a <i>status</i> attribute is added to all resource object types, such as <i>OrderTaker</i> and <i>Oven</i>, and a class-level <i>duration</i> function is added to all activity classes.</li></ol><figure id="Make-and-Deliver-Pizza__figMakeAndDeliverPizzaIDM"><img alt="???" src="_res/Pizzeria_IDMa.svg" width="500" /><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-1</span>. </span>An information design model defining object, event and activity types.</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how functions representing random variables, like the <code>duration</code> function of all activity types, are marked with the keyword (or UML 'stereotype') «rv» standing for &quot;random variable&quot;. These random variable functions sample from a probability distribution function (PDF), which is symbolically indicated with expressions like <i>Tri(30,40,50)</i> standing for the <em>triangular</em> PDF with lower and upper bounds 30 and 50 and a median of 40, or <i>DU(1,4)</i> standing for the discrete uniform PDF with lower and upper bounds 3 and 6.</p><p>In the case of the event type <i>OrderCall</i>, the random variable function recurrence samples from an exponential PDF with five different event rates given for the five consecutive hours during which the pizza service operates.</p><p>The activity type <i>TakeOrder</i> is associated with the object type <i>OrderTaker</i> via the implicit resource role <i>orderTaker</i> (with a resource cardinality constraint of &quot;exactly 1&quot;), indicated with the association end stereotype «rr» standing for &quot;resource role&quot;. A resource role assigns resource objects to activities. </p><p>Likewise, <i>MakePizza</i> is associated with <i>PizzaMaker</i> and <i>Oven</i> via the (implicitly named) resource roles <i>pizzaMakers</i>, having a resource cardinality constraint of &quot;exactly 2&quot;, and <i>oven</i>, having a resource cardinality constraint of &quot;exactly 1&quot;.</p><p>An <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design diagram like the one above, defines resource roles (like <i>pizzaMakers</i>), resource role types (like <i>PizzaMaker</i>) and resource cardinality constraints (like &quot;exactly 2&quot;) for all types of activities. Normally, in an <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> simulation there is a one-to-one correspondence between resource role types and resource pools. By convention, a resource pool has the same name as the corresponding resource role type, yet pluralized and starting with a lowercase character. For instance, the name of the resource pool for <i>PizzaMaker</i> is <i>pizzaMakers</i>.</p><p>Notice that <i>OrderCall</i> events are exogenous, having a recurrence function defined case-wise for each of the five hours per day operation of the pizza service company (in the attached invariant box).</p>For implementing the waiting timeout event defined in the process model, the activity type <i>TakeOrder</i> has a class-level <i>waitingTimeout</i> function implementing a random variable with PDF <i>U(3,6)</i>.</details><details open="open"><summary>Process Design Model</summary><p>A process design model, in the form of a DPMN process diagram as shown below, is derived from a conceptual process model by abstracting away from items that are not design-relevant and possibly adding certain computational details. </p><p>A <abbr title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process design model (like the one shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Make-and-Deliver-Pizza__figMakeAndDeliverPizzaPDM1"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-2</span></span></a>) essentially defines the admissible sequences of events and activities together with their dependencies and effects on objects, while its underlying <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design model (like the one shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Make-and-Deliver-Pizza__figMakeAndDeliverPizzaIDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-1</span></span></a>) defines the types of objects, events and activities, together with the participation of objects in events and activities, including the resource roles of activities, as well as resource cardinality constraints, parallel participation constraints, alternative resources, and task priorities. </p><figure id="Make-and-Deliver-Pizza__figMakeAndDeliverPizzaPDM1"><img src="_res/Pizzeria_PDM.svg" width="450" /><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-2</span>. </span>A process design for the Make-and-Deliver-Pizza business process</figcaption></figure><p>It is an option, though, to enrich a <abbr title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process design model by displaying more computational details, especially the recurrence of exogenous events, the duration of activities and the most important resource management features defined in the underlying <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design model, such as resource roles (in particular, performer roles can be displayed in the form of <em>Lanes</em>) and resource cardinality constraints. The following model shows an enriched version of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Make-and-Deliver-Pizza__figMakeAndDeliverPizzaPDM1"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-2</span></span></a>:</p><figure id="Make-and-Deliver-Pizza__figMakeAndDeliverPizzaPDM2"><img src="_res/Pizzeria_PDM2.svg" width="550" /><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-3</span>. </span>An enriched process design model</figcaption></figure><p>Such an enriched <abbr title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process design model includes all computational details needed for an implementation without a separate explicit <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design model. In fact, such a process model implicitly defines a corresponding class model. For instance, the enriched <abbr title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Make-and-Deliver-Pizza__figMakeAndDeliverPizzaPDM2"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-3</span></span></a> implicitly defines the <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Make-and-Deliver-Pizza__figMakeAndDeliverPizzaIDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-1</span></span></a> above.</p><p>The notation for defining performer roles in <em>Lanes</em> consists of a performer role name (such as <i>pizzaMakers</i>) and and an object type name (such as <i>PizzaMaker</i>) denoting its range, separated by a colon. When the performer role name is appended by a multiplicity expression in brackets, as in <i>pizzaMakers[2]</i>, this denotes a resource cardinality constraint (stating that exactly 2 pizzaMakers are required). When only a performer type prefixed with a colon (such as <i>:OrderTaker</i>) is provided, this means that the implicit performer role name is obtained by lowercasing the performer type name (as in <i>orderTaker:OrderTaker</i>).</p>The notation for defining a non-performer resource role, such as <i>oven:Oven</i>, consists of a named object rectangle, such as the <i>:Oven</i> rectangle in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Make-and-Deliver-Pizza__figMakeAndDeliverPizzaPDM2"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-3</span></span></a>, attached to an activity rectangle by means of a connection line with a small filled square representing a resource link, such as the line between the <i>MakePizza</i> activity rectangle and the <i>:Oven</i> object rectangle in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Make-and-Deliver-Pizza__figMakeAndDeliverPizzaPDM2"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-3</span></span></a>.<p>Notice that the model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Make-and-Deliver-Pizza__figMakeAndDeliverPizzaPDM2"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-3</span></span></a> does not include any element representing a resource pool. It is assumed that for any organizational position described in the underlying <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class model, the organization under consideration has a corresponding resource pool. By default , each resource role of an activity type is associated with a resource pool having the same (yet pluralized) name, such that its resources are instances of a corresponding resource role type, which is an organizational position in the case of human resources. </p><p>For instance, for the <i>MakePizza</i> activity a pool <i>ovens</i> is assigned to its resource role <i>oven</i> by default. The members of the pool <i>ovens</i> are instances of the (resource) object type <i>Oven</i>. Likewise, a pool <i>pizzaMakers</i> is assigned to the <i>MakePizza</i> resource role <i>pizzaMaker</i>. The members of this pool are instances of the organizational position <i>PizzaMaker</i>. These default pool assignments are normally not shown in a DPMN diagram, but an <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> simulator takes care of them.</p>Combined with its underlying <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design model, a <abbr title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process design model provides a computationally complete specification of a simulation model.</details></details><details open="open"><summary>Model Variant: Orders May Also Be Taken by Pizza Makers</summary><p>For decreasing the number of lost orders due to long waiting times, it is advisable to charge pizza makers with taking orders whenever no order taker is available. In resource management terminology, the organizational position <i>pizza maker</i> is redefined by adding the performer role <i>order taker</i> to its portfolio of organizational roles. </p><p>In a conceptual <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class diagram, this can be expressed by adding a subtyping arrow from <i>pizza makers</i> to <i>order takers</i> categorized as an <em><b>alternative resource subtyping</b></em> arrow with the stereotype «ar», as shown in the following diagram:</p><figure><img alt="conceptual information model describing object, event and activity types" src="_res/Pizzeria-AlternativeResourceSubtyping_IDM.svg" width="450" /></figure><p>The <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design diagram is extended in the same way, by adding an <em>alternative resource subtyping</em> arrow from <i>PizzaMaker</i> to <i>OrderTaker</i>.</p><p>The DPMN process design model is not affected by this change.</p></details></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-previous"><a href="CaseStudies-Intro.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-previous-icon" title="Previous page
