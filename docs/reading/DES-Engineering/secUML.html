The most important kinds of relationships between entity types to be described in an information model are <b><i>associations</i></b> and <b><i>subtype</i></b>/<i>supertype</i> relationships, which are called ‘generalizations’ in <i>UML</i>.</p><p>In UML Class Diagrams, an entity type is described with a name, and possibly with a list of <b><i>properties</i></b> and <b><i>operations</i></b> (called <i>methods</i> when implemented), in the form of a <i>class rectangle</i> with one, two or three compartments, depending on the presence of properties and operations. <b><i>Integrity constraints</i></b>, which are conditions that must be satisfied by the instances of a type, can be expressed in special ways when defining properties or they can be explicitly attached to an entity type in the form of an <i>invariant</i> box.</p><p>An <b><i>association</i></b> between two entity types is expressed as a connection line between the two class rectangles representing the entity types. The connection line is annotated with <i>multiplicity</i> expressions at both ends. A <b><i>multiplicity</i></b> expression has the form <code>m..n</code> where <i>m</i> is a non-negative natural number denoting the <i>minimum cardinality</i>, and <i>n</i> is a positive natural number (or the special symbol * standing for <i>unbounded)</i> denoting the maximum cardinality, of the sets of associated entities. Typically, a multiplicity expression states an integrity constraint. For instance, the multiplicity expression <code>1..3</code> means that there are at least 1 and at most 3 associated entities. However, the special multiplicity expression <code>0..*</code> (also expressed as <code>*</code>) means that there is no constraint since the minimum cardinality is zero and the maximum cardinality is unbounded.</p><p>For instance, the model shown in <a href="#secUML__figShopDelivery">Figure 3</a> describes the entity types <code>Shop</code> and <code>Delivery</code>, and it states that</p><ol><li>there are two classes: <code>Shop</code> and <code>Delivery</code>, representing entity types;</li><li>there is a one-to-many association between the classes <code>Shop</code> and <code>Delivery</code>, where a shop is the <code>receiver</code> of a delivery.</li></ol><figure id="secUML__figShopDelivery"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-2</span>. </span>The entity types Shop and Delivery.</figcaption><img src="_res/IntroUML1.svg" width="400" /></figure><p>Using further compartments in class rectangles, we can add properties and operations. For instance, in the model shown in <a href="#secUML__figShopDelivery2">Figure 4</a>, we have added</p><ol><li>the properties <em>name</em> and <em>stockQuantity</em> to <code>Shop</code> and <em>quantity</em> to <code>Delivery</code>,</li><li>the instance-level operation <em>onEvent</em> to <code>Delivery</code>,</li><li>the class-level operation <em>leadTime</em> to <code>Delivery</code>.</li></ol><figure id="secUML__figShopDelivery2"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-3</span>. </span>Adding properties and operations.</figcaption><img src="_res/IntroUML2.svg" width="450" /></figure><p>Notice that in <a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#_Ref493071591">Figure 4</a>, each property is declared together with a datatype as its <em>range</em>. Likewise, operations are declared with a (possibly empty) list of parameters, and with an optional return value type. When an operation (or property) declaration is underlined, this means that it is class-level instead of instance-level. For instance, the underlined operation declaration <u><code>leadTime(): Decimal</code></u> indicates that <em>leadTime</em> is a class-level operation that does not take any argument and returns a decimal number.</p><p>We may want to define various types of integrity constraints for better capturing the semantics of entity types, properties and operations. The model shown in <a href="#secUML__figShopDelivery3">Figure 5</a> contains an example of a property constraint and an example of an operation constraint. These types of constraints can be expressed within curly braces appended to a property or operation declaration. The keyword <code>id</code> in the declaration of the property <code>name</code> in the <code>Shop</code> class expresses an ID constraint stating that the property is a standard identifier, or primary key, attribute. The expression <code>Exp(0.5)</code> in the declaration of the random variable operation <code>leadTime</code> in the <code>Delivery</code> class denotes the constraint that the operation must implement the <em>exponential</em> probability distribution function with event rate 0.5.</p><figure id="secUML__figShopDelivery3"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-4</span>. </span>Adding a property constraint and an operation constraint.</figcaption><img src="_res/IntroUML3.svg" width="500" /></figure><p>UML allows defining special categories of modeling elements called <q>stereotypes</q>. For instance, for distinguishing between <b><i>object types</i></b> and <b><i>event types</i></b> as two different categories of entity types we can define corresponding stereotypes of UML classes («object type» and «event type») and use them for categorizing classes in class models, as shown in <a href="#secUML__figShopDelivery4">Figure 6</a>.</p><figure id="secUML__figShopDelivery4"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-5</span>. </span>Object and event types as two different categories of entity types.</figcaption><img src="_res/IntroUML4.svg" width="500" /></figure><p>Another example of using UML’s stereotype feature is the designation of an operation as a function that represents a <em>random variable</em> using the operation stereotype «rv» in the diagram of <a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#_Ref493015782">Figure 6</a>.</p><p>A class may be defined as <em>abstract</em> by writing its name in italics, as in the example model of <a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#_Ref493094582">Figure 11</a>. An abstract class cannot have direct instances. It can only be indirectly instantiated by objects that are direct instances of a subclass.</p><p>A good overview of the most recent version of UML (UML 2.5) is provided by <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-25-diagrams.html">www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-25-diagrams.html</a>.</p></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-previous"><a href="secMDE.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-previous-icon" title="Previous page
