In philosophy, objects have also been called <em>endurants</em> or <em>continuants</em>, while events have also been called <em>perdurants</em> or <em>occurrents</em>.</p><p>OEM&amp;S combines <em>Object-Oriented</em> (OO) Modeling with the <em>event scheduling</em> paradigm of <em>Event Graphs</em> (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358460">Schruben 1983</a>). The relevant <i>object types</i> and <i>event types</i> are described in an information model, which is the basis for making a process model. A modeling approach that follows the OEM paradigm is called an <i>OEM approach</i>. Such an approach needs to choose, or define, an information modeling language (such as <em>Entity Relationship Diagrams</em> or <em>UML Class Diagrams</em>) and a process modeling language (such as <em>UML Activity Diagrams</em> or <em>BPMN Process Diagrams</em>).</p><p>We propose an OEM approach based on <em>UML Class Diagrams</em> for conceptual information modeling and information design modeling, as well as <em>DPMN Process Diagrams</em> for conceptual process modeling and for process design modeling. </p><p>In the proposed approach, object types and event types are modeled as special categories of classes in a UML Class Diagram. <i>Random variables</i> are modeled as a special category of class-level operations constrained to comply with a specific probability distribution such that they can be implemented as static methods of a class. <i>Queues</i> are not modeled as objects, but rather as ordered association ends, which can be implemented as collection-valued reference properties. Finally, <i>event rules</i>, which include <i>event routines</i>, are modeled in DPMN process diagrams (and possibly also in pseudo-code), such that they can be implemented in the form of special <i>onEvent</i> methods of event classes.</p><p>Like Petri Nets and DEVS, OEM&amp;S has a formal semantics. But while Petri Nets and DEVS are abstract computational formalisms without an ontological foundation, OEM&amp;S is based on the ontological categories of objects, events and causal regularities.</p><p>In model-based simulation engineering, we distinguish between (1) a <em>conceptual model</em> describing a real-world problem domain, and (2) a <em>simulation design model</em> defining a certain computational solution for the purpose of a simulation study. Both conceptual models and design models consist of an <em>OE class model</em> describing/defining the system's <em>state structure</em> (in the form of <em>object types</em> and <em>event types</em>, and the <em>associations</em> between them) and a <em>DPMN process model</em> describing/defining the system's <em>dynamics</em> (in the form of <em>causal regularities</em> captured by <em>event rules</em>).</p><p>An OEM approach results in a simulation design model that has a well-defined operational semantics in terms of a transition system based on the event rules modeled in a DPMN process design diagram, as shown by Wagner (<a href="https://www.informs-sim.org/wsc17papers/includes/files/056.pdf">2017a</a>). Such a model can, in principle, be implemented with any object-oriented (OO) simulation technology. However, a straightforward implementation can only be expected from a technology that implements the OEM&amp;S paradigm, such as the <a href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/index.html">OES JavaScript (OESjs)</a> framework.</p></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-previous"><a href="secBPMN.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-previous-icon" title="Previous page
