In the DES literature, it is often stated that DES is based on the concept of <q>entities flowing through the system</q> (more precisely, through a <q>queueing network</q>). This is the paradigm of an entire class of simulation software in the tradition of GPSS (<a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#Gordon61">Gordon, 1961</a>) and SIMAN/Arena (<a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#Peg92">Pegden &amp; Davis, 1992</a>). However, this paradigm characterizes a special (yet important) class of DES only, it does not apply to all discrete event systems.</p><p><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/019.pdf">Pegden (2010)</a> explains that the 50 year history of DES has been shaped by three fundamental paradigms: <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2009/RM3310.pdf">Markowitz, Hausner and Karr (1962)</a> pioneered the <i>event worldview</i> with <i lang="en-GB">SIMSCRIPT</i>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1460764.1460768">Gordon (1961)</a> pioneered the <i>Processing Network worldview</i> with <i>GPSS</i>, and <a href="http://simula67.at.ifi.uio.no/Archive/artikkel1966cacm.pdf">Dahl and Nygaard (1967)</a> pioneered the <i>object worldview</i> with <i>Simula</i>. Notice that we have changed Pegden’s original name “process worldview” to “Processing Network worldview” because this paradigm is not based on a general concept of processes, but rather on a special concept of <i>processing processes</i> where entities are subject to processing steps performed at the nodes of a (queueing) network.</p><p>While the concept of an event is often limited to instantaneous events in the area of DES, the general concept of an event, as discussed in philosophy and in many fields of computer science, includes composite events and events with non-zero duration.</p><p>A <em>discrete event system</em> (or <em>discrete dynamic system</em>) consists of</p><ul><li>objects (of various types) having a state (consisting of qualities) and dispositions,</li><li>events (of various types) triggering certain dispositions of objects participating in them,</li></ul><p>such that the states of affected objects may be changed by events according to the dispositions triggered by them. It is natural to consider the concept of <em>discrete events</em>, occurring at times from a discrete set of time points.</p><p>For modeling a discrete event system as a state transition system, we have to describe its</p><ol><li><b> <i>object types</i> </b>, e.g., in the form of <em>classes</em> of an object-oriented language;</li><li><b> <i>event types</i> </b>, e.g., in the form of <em>classes</em> of an object-oriented language;</li><li><b> <i>causal regularities</i> </b> (<em>disposition types</em>) e.g., in the form of <em>event rules</em>.</li></ol><p>Any DES formalism has one or more language elements that allow specifying <em>event rules</em> representing causal regularities. These rules specify, for any event type, the <em>state changes</em> of objects and the <em>follow-up events</em> caused by the occurrence of an event of that type, thus defining the dynamics of the transition system. Unfortunately, this is often obscured by the standard definitions of DES that are repeatedly presented in simulation textbooks and tutorials.</p><p>According to Pegden (<a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#Peg10">2010</a>), a <em>simulation modeling worldview</em> provides <q>a framework for defining a system in sufficient detail that it can be executed to simulate the behavior of the system</q>. It <q>must precisely define the dynamic state transitions that occur over time</q>. Pegden explains that the 50 year history of DES has been shaped by three fundamental paradigms: Markowitz, Hausner, and Karr (<a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#MarkHK62">1962</a>) pioneered the <em>event worldview</em> with <em>SIMSCRIPT</em>, Gordon (<a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#Gordon61">1961</a>) pioneered the <em>processing network worldview</em> with <em>GPSS</em>, and Dahl and Nygaard (<a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#DahlNygaard66">1966</a>) pioneered the <em>object worldview</em> with <em>Simula</em>. Pegden characterizes these paradigms in the following way:</p><p><b><i>Event worldview</i></b>: The system is viewed as a series of instantaneous events that change the state of the system over time. The modeler defines the events in the system and models the state changes that take place when those events occur. According to Pegden, the event worldview is the most fundamental worldview since the other worldviews also use events, at least implicitly.</p><p><b><i>Processing Network worldview</i></b>: The system under investigation is described as a processing network where <q>entities flow through the system</q> (or, more precisely, work objects are routed through the network) and are subject to a series of processing steps performed at processing nodes through processing activities, possibly requiring resources and inducing queues of work objects waiting for the availability of resources (processing networks have been called <q>queueing networks</q> in Operations Research). This approach allows high-level modeling with semi-visual languages and is therefore the most widely used DES approach nowadays, in particular in manufacturing industries and service industries. Simulation platforms based on this worldview may or may not support object-oriented modeling and programming.</p><p><b><i>Object worldview</i></b>: The system is modeled by describing the objects that make up the system. The system behavior emerges from the <q>interaction</q> of these objects.</p><p>All three worldviews lack important conceptual elements. The event worldview does not consider objects with their (categorical and dispositional) properties. The processing network worldview neither considers events nor objects. And the object worldview, while it considers objects with their <em>categorical</em> properties, does not consider events. None of the three worldviews includes modeling the <em>dispositional</em> properties of objects with a full-fledged explicit concept of <em>event rules</em>.</p><p>The event worldview and the object worldview can be combined in approaches that support both objects and events as first-class citizens. This seems highly desirable because (1) objects (and classes) are a must-have in today’s state-of-the-art modeling and programming, and (2) a general concept of events is fundamental in DES, as demonstrated by the classical event worldview. We use the term <em>object-event worldview</em> for any DES approach combining OO modeling and programming with a general concept of events.</p></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-previous"><a href="chIntroduction.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-previous-icon" title="Previous page
