When a customer arrives at the DMV, she first has to queue up at the reception desk where data for her case is recorded. The customer then goes to the waiting area and waits for being called by the case handling desk where her case will be processed. After completing the case handling, the customer leaves the DMV via the exit.</p><p>Customer arrivals are modeled with an «entry node» element (with name “DMV entry”), the two consecutive service desks are modeled with two «processing node» elements, and the departure of customers is modeled with an «exit node» element (with name “DMV exit”).</p><p>DPMN is extended by adding the new modeling elements of <em>PN Node</em> rectangles, representing node objects, and <em>PN Object Flow</em> arrows, representing combined object-event flows. PN Node rectangles take the form of stereotyped UML object rectangles, while PN Object Flow arrows have a special arrow head consisting of a circle and three bars, as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secPN-CM__figDmvCPM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-3</span></span></a>. </p><figure id="secPN-CM__figDmvCPM"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-3</span>. </span>A PN model using the new DPMN modeling elements of PN Node rectangles and PN Flow arrows</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="_res/DMV_CPM.svg" width="600" /></div></figure></section><section><h4>Using both Object Flow arrows and Event Scheduling arrows</h4><p>While an Object Flow arrow between two nodes implies both a flow of the processing object to the successor node and the resource-dependent scheduling of the next processing activity, an Event Scheduling arrow from a processing node to an Event circle represents an event flow where a processing activity end event causes/schedules another event, as illustrated in the example of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secPN-CM__figDMVCPM2"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-4</span></span></a>.</p><figure id="secPN-CM__figDMVCPM2"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-4</span>. </span>A DPMN-PN process diagram with an Event Scheduling arrow </figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="_res/DMV_CPM2.svg" width="600" /></div></figure></section></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-previous"><a href="chProcessingActivities-Intro.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-previous-icon" title="Previous page
