Depending on the purposes/goals of a simulation study, it may abstract away from certain elements of the real-world domain described by the conceptual model, and it adds computational elements representing design decisions, such as <em>random variables</em> expressed int he form of random variate sampling functions based on specific probability distributions for modeling the random variation of certain system variables.</p><p>An information design model of the single workstation system described above is shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#OEM-Example-Workstation__figWS2_IDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">2-3</span></span></a>. This model defines the multi-valued <code>waitingParts</code> association end to be ordered, which means that it corresponds to a multi-valued reference property holding an ordered collection (such as an array list or a queue) as its value. </p><p>The information design model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#OEM-Example-Workstation__figWS2_IDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">2-3</span></span></a> defines that a <i>PartArrival</i> event must reference both a <i>Part</i> and a <i>WorkStation</i>, representing situations where specific parts arrive at specific workstations. Notice that, computationally, this model requires creating new <i>Part</i> objects (or retrieving them from an object pool) before a new <i>PartArrival</i> event is created (or scheduled), while it is more common in simulation models to create a new <i>Part</i> object only when an arrival event has occurred, which can be modeled by defining a multiplicity of 0..1 for the <i>Part</i> end of the <i>PartArrival</i>-<i>Part</i> association (with the meaning that <i>PartArrival</i> has an optional, instead of a mandatory, reference property with name <i>part</i>).</p><figure id="OEM-Example-Workstation__figWS2_IDM"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">2-3</span>. </span>An information design model</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="_res/WS2_IDM.svg" /></div></figure><p>Notice that the model defines two class level operations (designated with the stereotype «rv») implementing random variate sampling functions: <code>PartArrival::recurrence()</code> complies with a triangular probability distribution with minimum, mode and maximum parameter values 3, 4 and 8, while <code>ProcessingStart::processingTime()</code> complies with an exponential distribution with a mean of 6.</p><p>A process design model based on the object and event types defined by the information design model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#OEM-Example-Workstation__figWS2_IDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">2-3</span></span></a> and derived from the conceptual process model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#OEM-Example-Workstation__figWS_CPM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">2-2</span></span></a> is shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#OEM-Example-Workstation__figWS2_PDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">2-4</span></span></a>.</p><figure id="OEM-Example-Workstation__figWS2_PDM"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">2-4</span>. </span>A process design model in the form of a DPMN Process Diagram</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="_res/WS2_PDM.svg" /></div></figure><p>Notice that, since all events happen at the same workstation, all three event scheduling arrows are annotated with the same event property assignment <code>workStation := ws</code>, which simply propagates the object reference to the given workstation along the event scheduling chain. Such property propagation assignments (in event property assignment annotations), where a property value of a follow-up event is set to the corresponding property value of the scheduling (or triggering) event, will be omitted (as implied by event types having the same property names) for avoiding to clutter the process model diagrams.</p><p>A DPMN Process Diagram, like the one shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#OEM-Example-Workstation__figWS2_PDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">2-4</span></span></a>, can be split up into a set of event rule diagrams, one for each of its Event circles, as shown in the following table. This reduction of a DPMN process design model to a set of event rule design models, together with the operational semantics of event rules presented in (Wagner 2017a), provides the semantics of DPMN Process Diagrams. </p><p>Notice that an event rule design model can also be expressed textually in the form of a pseudo-code block with four parts: part 1 indicates the triggering event type and declares a rule variable representing the triggering event, part 2 declares further rule variables and initializes them, part 3 contains a state change script consisting of state change statements, and part 4 schedules follow-up events.</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th>Rule design model</th><th>Pseudo-code</th></tr><tr><td><img src="_res/WS2_RDM_PartArrival.svg" /></td><td><table border="1"><thead><tr><th>ON a:PartArrival</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ws : WorkStation<br />ws := a.workStation</td></tr><tr><td>ws.waitingParts.enqueue( a.part)</td></tr><tr><td>IF ws.status = AVAILABLE <br />THEN SCHEDULE ProcessingStart( workStation:=ws)</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><img src="_res/WS2_RDM_ProcStart.svg" /></td><td><table border="1"><thead><tr><th>ON ps:ProcessingStart</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ws : WorkStation<br />ws := ps.workStation</td></tr><tr><td>ws.status := BUSY</td></tr><tr><td>SCHEDULE ProcessingEnd( workStation:=ws) <br />DELAYED BY ProcessingStart.processingTime()</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><img src="_res/WS2_RDM_ProcEnd.svg" /></td><td><table border="1"><thead><tr><th>ON pe:ProcessingEnd</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ws : WorkStation<br />ws := pe.workStation</td></tr><tr><td>ws.waitingParts.dequeue()<br />IF ws.waitingParts.length = 0 <br />THEN ws.status := AVAILABLE</td></tr><tr><td>IF ws.waitingParts.length &gt; 0 <br />THEN SCHEDULE ProcessingStart( workStation:=ws)</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></section></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-previous"><a href="ES-without-Objects.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-previous-icon" title="Previous page
