Typically, a resource-constrained activity is a component of a business process that happens in the context of an organization or organizational unit, which is associated with the activity as its <em>Process Owner</em>. </p><p>An activity of a certain type may require certain resources for being performable. At any point in time, a resource required for performing an activity may be <em>available</em> or not. A resource is not available, for instance, when it is is <em>busy</em> or when it is <em>out of order</em>.</p><aside class="rightbox40"><h3>Summary</h3><ol><li>A Resource-Constrained Activity can only be started when the required resources are available.</li><li>Which participants of a Resource-Constrained Activity of type <i>A</i> play the role of a resource is defined in an OE Class Diagram by special properties of <i>A</i>, called <em>Resource Roles</em>.</li><li><em>Resource (Cardinality) Constraints</em> are defined in an OE Class Diagram in the form of multiplicities of Resource Roles.</li><li>The resources that are available for being allocated to a planned activity are provided by <em>Resource Pools</em> managed by Process Owners. A Resource Pool is modeled in an OE Class Diagram as a collection-valued reference property of the object type representing the Process Owner.</li><li>A <em>Resource Type</em> is defined in an OE Class Diagram as a special object type that has a resource <em>status</em> attribute and is the range of both a Resource Role and a Resource Pool property.</li><li>A <em>Resource-Dependent Activity Start</em> arrow is a high-level modeling element of DPMN Process Diagrams, merging the semantics of event scheduling arrows with the Allocate-Release modeling pattern.</li><li>OEM-A extends basic OEM by adding activities, resource roles, resource cardinality constraints, resource pools, resource types and resource-dependent activity start arrows. Notice that most of these resource modeling elements are expressed in an OE Class Diagram, and only the possible event flows are expressed in a DPMN Process Diagram (representing an OEM process model) with the help of Resource-Dependent Activity Start arrows.</li></ol></aside><p>Resources are objects of a certain type. The resource objects of an activity include its <em>performer</em>, as expressed in the diagram shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#ResourceConstrainedActivities-Intro__figActRes"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-6</span></span></a>. While in a conceptual model, describing a real-world system, a performer is required for any activity, a simulation design model may abstract away from the performer of an activity.</p><p>For instance, a consultation activity may require a consultant and a room. Such <em>resource cardinality constraints</em> are defined at the type level. When defining the activity type <code>Consultation</code>, these resource cardinality constraints are defined in the form of two mandatory associations with the object types <code>Consultant</code> and <code>Room</code> such that both associations' ends have the multiplicity 1 (&quot;exactly one&quot;). Then, in a simulation run, a new <code>Consultation</code> activity can only be started, when both a <code>Consultant</code> object and a <code>Room</code> object are available.</p><p>For all types of resource-constrained activities, a simulator can automatically collect the following statistics:</p><ol><li><i>Throughput</i> statistics: the numbers of enqueued and dequeued planned activities, and the numbers of started and completed activities.</li><li><i>Queue length</i> statistics (average, maximum, etc.) of its queue of planned activities.</li><li><i>Cycle time</i> statistics (average, maximum, etc.), where cycle time is the sum of the waiting time and the activity duration.</li><li><i>Resource utilization</i> statistics: the percentage of time each resource object involved is busy with an activity of that type.</li></ol><p>In addition, a simulator can automatically collect the percentage of time each resource object involved is idle or out-of-order.</p><figure id="ResourceConstrainedActivities-Intro__figActRes"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-6</span>. </span>The resources required for performing an activity include the activity's performer.</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="_res/ResourceConstrained-Activities.svg" /></div></figure><p>For modeling resource-constrained activities, we need to define their types. As can be seen in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#ResourceConstrainedActivities-Intro__figIndividualsAndTypes"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-7</span></span></a>, a resource-constrained activity type is composed of </p><ol><li>a set of <em>properties</em> and a set of <em>operations</em>, as any entity type,</li><li>a set of <strong>resource roles</strong>, each one having the form of a reference property with a name, an object type as range, and a multiplicity that may define a <strong>resource cardinality constraint</strong> like, e.g., &quot;exactly one resource object of this type is required&quot; or &quot;at least two resource objects of this type are required&quot;.</li></ol><p>The resource roles defined for an activity type may include the performer role.</p><figure id="ResourceConstrainedActivities-Intro__figIndividualsAndTypes"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-7</span>. </span>Activity types may have special properties representing resource roles.</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="_res/Types-with-ResourceRoles.svg" /></div></figure><p>These considerations show that a simulation language for simulating activities needs to allow defining activity types with two kinds of properties: ordinary properties and resource roles. At least for the latter ones, it must be possible to define multiplicities for defining resource cardinality constraints. These requirements are fulfilled by OE Class Diagrams where resource roles are defined as stereotyped properties using the stereotype «resource role» or, shorter, «res».</p><p>The extension of basic OEM by adding the concepts needed for modeling resource-constrained activities (in particular, resource roles with constraints, resource pools, and resource-dependent activity start arrows) is called <em>OEM-A</em>.</p></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-previous"><a href="secDesM.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-previous-icon" title="Previous page
