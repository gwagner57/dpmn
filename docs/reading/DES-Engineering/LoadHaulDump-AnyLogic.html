Rather, we have to figure out what we could use as &quot;entities&quot; for being able to make a PN model.</p><p>One option is to use the five trucks of the haul service company as the entities (called &quot;agents&quot; in AnyLogic), which arrive at a truck <em>entry node</em> and &quot;flow&quot; through the <em>processing nodes</em> Load, Haul and Dump before they leave the system via a truck <em>exit node</em>. Although this approach is quite artificial, imposing the PN paradigm on the given problem, it allows us using AnyLogic.</p><p>Notice that AnyLogic, like many other simulation tools, has adopted the <em>Seize-Delay-Release</em> pattern for modeling resource-constrained activities introduced by the simulation language GPSS in 1961. This means that activities are essentially modeled as <i>Delay</i> elements.</p><details open="open"><summary>Implementing the Information Design Model with AnyLogic</summary><p>From the information design model, we can only take the following items into consideration:</p><ol><li>All model variables are implemented as AnyLogic variables (defined in <i>Main</i>).</li><li>The <i>duration</i> functions defined in activity types are implemented as the <i>Delay times</i> of corresponding AnyLogic <i>Delay</i> or <i>Service</i> elements.</li><li>The <em>resource roles</em> defined for activity types are implemented either as <i>Seize</i> elements or as <i>Seize</i> information items within <i>Service</i> elements (if they had not to be transformed into entities, like the trucks of the Load-Haul-Dump model).</li></ol><p>For instance, the activity type <i>Load</i> with its resource roles <i>wheelLoader</i> and <i>truck</i> is implemented as a <i>Service</i> element with</p><figure class="right"><img alt="???" src="_res/LoadHaulDump-Load_IDM.svg" width="400" /></figure><ol><li>its <i>duration</i> function, sampling the U(10,20) distribution, entered as &quot;uniform(10,20)&quot; in the <i>Delay time</i> field of the <i>Load</i> Service element.</li><li>its resource role <i>wheelLoader</i> entered in the form of a resource pool <i>wheelLoaders</i> in the <i>Resource pool</i> field of the <i>Load</i> Service element, and its resource cardinality constraint of exactly one entered as &quot;1&quot; in the field <i>number of units</i>.</li></ol></details><details open="open"><summary>Implementing the Process Design Model with AnyLogic</summary><figure id="LoadHaulDump-AnyLogic__lof__75"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-16</span>. </span>A DPMN process design model for the Load-Haul-Dump business process.</figcaption><img alt="???" src="_res/LoadHaulDump_PDM.svg" width="600" /></figure><p>While the DPMN process starts with the event <i>HaulRequest</i>, the AnyLogic process starts with the entry node <i>truckEntry</i> (a &quot;source&quot; element) having the field <i>&quot;Arrivals defined by&quot;</i> set to &quot;Calls of inject() function&quot;, which means that, for creating 5 trucks arriving at <i>truckEntry</i>, the inject function needs to be invoked in the <i>&quot;On startup&quot;</i> procedure of <i>Main</i> in the following way: <code>truckEntry.inject(5)</code>.</p><p>For simplicity, the <i>GoToLoadingSite</i> activity of the DPMN model is discarded.</p><figure id="LoadHaulDump-AnyLogic__lof__76"><img alt="???" height="245" src="_res/AnyLogic-Load-Haul-Dump-Screenshot.png" width="712" /><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-17</span>. </span>An AnyLogic process diagram for the Load-Haul-Dump business process.</figcaption></figure><p>As explained above, the activity type <i>Load</i> is implemented as a <i>Service</i> element with a <i>&quot;Delay time&quot;</i> of &quot;uniform(10,20)&quot; and the field <i>&quot;Resource pool&quot;</i> set to &quot;wheelLoaders&quot; with <i>&quot;number of units&quot;</i> set to 1.</p><p>All other activity types are implemented as <i>Delay</i> elements (with a <i>&quot;Delay time&quot;</i> provided by their <i>duration</i> function defined in the class model).</p><p>The two decision diamonds of the DPMN model are implemented with corresponding <i>&quot;SelectOutput&quot;</i> elements called &quot;test_if_job_done_1&quot; and &quot;test_if_job_done_2&quot;.</p><blockquote class="role-attention"><p>Unfortunately, PN modeling tools, like AnyLogic, do not support the general concept of activities (and Activity Networks), but only the special concept of <em>processing activities</em>. A processing activity has a <em>processing object</em> (&quot;entity&quot;) as a mandatory participant, in addition to resource objects. While in a PN model, processing nodes do have a location and a <em>processing capacity</em> (the number of processing objects that can be processed in parallel), the nodes of an Activity Network (like the Load-Haul-Dump model), representing pure activities, in general do neither have a processing capacity nor a location.</p><p>For instance, in the AnyLogic Load-Haul-Dump model above, trucks are processing objects and the processing activity <i>Load</i> is performed at the processing node <i>Load</i> by a wheel loader that is processing a truck. Consequently, the <i>Load</i>, <i>Haul</i>, <i>Dump</i> and <i>GoBack</i> elements in the AnyLogic process diagram do not represent activities, but rather processing nodes. </p></blockquote></details></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-previous"><a href="Load-Haul-Dump-OESjs.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-previous-icon" title="Previous page
