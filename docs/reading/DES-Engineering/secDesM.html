In the example of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secDesM__figWorkstationIDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-3</span></span></a>, there is only one such feature: the class-level operation <code>ProcessingStart::processingTime</code>, which is allocated to <code>Processing</code> and renamed to <code>time</code>.</p></section><section id="secDesM__secAddingActivityRectanglesToPDMs"><h4>Extending basic DPMN process design diagrams by adding Activity rectangles</h4><figure id="secDesM__figWorkstationPDM"><figcaption style="text-align:center;"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-4</span>. </span>Going from basic DPMN to DPMN-A process models by introducing Activity rectangles.</figcaption><div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column"><div><img src="_res/WS2_PDM_2.svg" width="550" /></div><div><img src="_res/DownArrow.svg" width="30" /></div><div><img src="_res/WS3_PDM.svg" width="550" /></div></div></figure><p>In the case of a process design model, the replacement pattern implies that an Event circle pair consisting of an Event circle intended to represent activity start events and an Event circle intended to represent related activity end events, with an event scheduling arrow from the start to the end Event circle annotated by a delay expression, is replaced by an Activity rectangle such that:</p><ol><li>All Data Objects attached to the end Event circle get attached to the Activity rectangle (since an activity occurs when it it is completed).</li><li>All event scheduling arrows going out from the end Event circle are turned into event scheduling arrows going out from the Activity rectangle.</li><li>All start event scheduling arrows are replaced with corresponding activity scheduling arrows having an additional creation parameter assignment for the <em>duration</em> of a scheduled activity, which is set to the delay expression defined for the end event scheduling arrow. In the example above, the duration parameter in the annotation of the two activity scheduling arrows is set to <code>Processing::time()</code> in the target diagram, which is the same as the delay <code>ProcessingStart::processingTime</code> in the source diagram.</li><li>When the start Event circle has one or more attached Data Objects or any outgoing event scheduling arrow that does not go to the end Event circle, then a start Event circle has to be included in the Activity rectangle for attaching the Data Object(s) and as the source of the outgoing event scheduling arrow(s).</li></ol><p>This <em>Activity-Start-End Rewrite Pattern</em>, which can also be applied in the inverse direction, replacing an Activity rectangle with an Event circle pair, defines the meaning of an Activity rectangle in a DPMN diagram. It allows reducing a DPMN-A diagram with Activity rectangles to a basic DPMN diagram without Activity rectangles.</p><p>Notice that, like the source model, also the target model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secDesM__figWorkstationPDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-4</span></span></a> specifies three event rules:</p><ol><li>On each <em>PartArrival</em> event, the arrived part is added to the workstation's input buffer and if the workstation's status is AVAILABLE, then a new <i>Processing</i> activity is scheduled to start immediately with a duration provided by invoking the <i>time</i> function defined in the <i>Processing</i> activity class.</li><li>When a <em><i>Processing</i></em> activity starts, the workstation's status is changed to BUSY.</li><li>When a <em><i>Processing</i></em> activity ends, the processed part is removed from the input buffer and, if the input buffer is not empty, a new <i>Processing</i> activity is scheduled to start immediately, otherwise (if the input buffer is empty) the workstation's status is changed to AVAILABLE.</li></ol></section><section><h4>An alternative process design model of the single workstation system</h4><p>Based on the same information design model, shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secDesM__figWorkstationIDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-3</span></span></a>, we can make another process design model of the single workstation system as an alternative to the target model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secDesM__figWorkstationPDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-4</span></span></a>.
