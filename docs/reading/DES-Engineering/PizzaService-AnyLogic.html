We use a baseline scenario with 2 order takers, 6 pizza makers, 3 ovens, and 10 scooters. </p><p>Since AnyLogic does not support Activity-Based Discrete Event Simulation, but only <a href="https://sim4edu.com/explain/what-is-process-oriented-simulation.html">Processing Network (PN)</a> simulations with &quot;entities flowing through the system&quot;, we need to impose a PN view on the Make-and-Deliver-Pizza business process. This requires to figure out what could be used as &quot;entities&quot; for being able to make a PN model. </p><p>Since in the real pizza service system there are no entities that flow through the system, we need to assume an artificial abstract entity like &quot;the order&quot;, which arrives at the order taker and then takes the form of the ordered pizza being delivered to the customer.</p><p>An enriched DPMN process design model, like the Make-and-Deliver-Pizza process model above, can be implemented with AnyLogic's Process Modeling Library by taking the following steps:</p><ol><li class="field">An exogenous event circle, like <i><b>OrderCall</b></i>, is turned into an entry node <i><i>OrderCall</i></i> (an AnyLogic &quot;Source&quot; element). Since the <i>OrderCall</i> event recurrence is defined case-wise for each of the five hours of the pizza service's operation, we set the field <i class="field">Arrivals defined by</i> to &quot;Rate schedule&quot; and set the field <i>Rate schedule</i> to the schedule that defines the arrivals (&quot;ArrivalSchedule&quot;).</li><li><p>The <i>TakeOrder</i> activity rectangle is implemented as a corresponding processing node (an AnyLogic &quot;Service&quot; element) by taking the following steps: </p><ol><li>The performer role <i>orderTaker:OrderTaker</i> (in the diagram abbreviated by <i>:OrderTaker</i>) is turned into a resource pool assignment in two steps: <ol><li>Defining an AnyLogic &quot;Resource Pool&quot; with name <i>orderTakers</i> and its field <i class="field">Capacity</i> set to the resource pool size defined by the chosen simulation scenario (like 2 in the baseline scenario).</li><li>Setting the <i class="field">Seize</i> field to &quot;units of the same pool&quot; and setting the <i class="field">Resource pool</i> field to the previously defined pool <i>orderTakers</i> (by selecting it from the drop-down list), while keeping the default value &quot;1&quot; in the field <i class="field">number of units</i> corresponding to the default resource cardinality constraint of &quot;exactly one&quot; of the performer role <i>:OrderTaker</i>.</li></ol></li><li>Since the <i>TakeOrder</i> task queue is unbounded, the yes/no field <i class="field">Maximum queue capacity</i> has to be checked.</li><li>The field <i class="field">Delay time</i> is set to an AnyLogic Java expression corresponding to the activity's duration value: <i>uniform(1,4)</i>.</li><li>Since the <i>TakeOrder</i> activity has a waiting timeout, the yes/no field <i class="field">Queue: exit on timeout</i> has to be checked and the field <i class="field">Timeout</i> is set to an AnyLogic Java expression corresponding to the activity's waiting timeout value: <i>uniform_discr(3,6)</i>, in the &quot;Service&quot; element's <i>Advanced</i> section.</li><li>Finally, the <i>LostOrder</i> event circle is implemented as a <i>LostOrder</i> exit node (an AnyLogic &quot;Sink&quot; element) attached to the &quot;Service&quot; element's timeout out-port.</li></ol></li><li><p>The <i><b>MakePizza</b></i> activity rectangle is implemented as a corresponding processing node (an AnyLogic &quot;Service&quot; element) by taking the following steps:</p><ol><li>The performer role <i>pizzaMakers:PizzaMaker</i> is turned into a resource pool assignment in two steps: <ol><li>Define an AnyLogic &quot;Resource Pool&quot; with name <i>pizzaMakers</i> and set its field <i class="field">Capacity</i> to the resource pool size defined by the chosen simulation scenario (like 6 in the baseline scenario).</li><li>Set the <i class="field">Seize</i> field to &quot;(alternative) resource sets&quot; and then create an entry in the field <i class="field">Resource sets (alternatives)</i> by selecting the pool <i>pizzaMakers</i> from the drop-down list and changing its default value &quot;1&quot; for the resource cardinality to &quot;2&quot; (because &quot;exactly 2&quot; pizza makers are required).</li></ol></li><li>The resource role <i>oven:Oven</i> is turned into a resource pool assignment in two steps: <ol><li>Define an AnyLogic &quot;Resource Pool&quot; with name <i>ovens</i> and set its field <i class="field">Capacity</i> to the resource pool size defined by the chosen simulation scenario (like 3 in the baseline scenario).</li><li>Create another entry in the field <i class="field">Resource sets (alternatives)</i> by selecting the pool <i>ovens</i> from the dropdown list (and leaving its default value &quot;1&quot; for the resource cardinality).</li></ol></li><li>Since the <i>MakePizza</i> task queue is unbounded, the yes/no field <i class="field">Maximum queue capacity</i> has to be checked.</li><li>The field <i class="field">Delay time</i> is set to an AnyLogic Java expression corresponding to the activity's duration value: <i>triangular(3, 6, 4)</i>.</li></ol></li><li><p>The <i><b>DeliverPizza</b></i> activity rectangle is implemented as a corresponding processing node (an AnyLogic &quot;Service&quot; element) by taking the following steps: </p><ol><li>For simplicity, the performer role <i>scooterDriver:ScooterDriver</i> (in the diagram abbreviated by <i>:ScooterDriver</i>) is merged with the resource role <i>scooter:Scooter</i> (abbreviated by <i>:Scooter</i>).</li><li>The resource role <i>scooter:Scooter</i> is turned into a resource pool assignment in two steps: <ol><li>Define an AnyLogic &quot;Resource Pool&quot; with name <i>scooters</i> and set its field <i class="field">Capacity</i> to the resource pool size defined by the chosen simulation scenario (like 10 in the baseline scenario).</li><li>Set the <i class="field">Seize</i> field to &quot;units of the same pool&quot; and set the <i class="field">Resource pool</i> field to the previously defined pool <i>scooters</i> (by selecting it from the drop-down list), while keeping the default value &quot;1&quot; in the field <i class="field">number of units</i> corresponding to the default resource cardinality constraint of &quot;exactly one&quot; of the resource role <i>:Scooter</i>.</li></ol></li><li>Since the <i>DeliverPizza</i> task queue is unbounded, the yes/no field <i class="field">Maximum queue capacity</i> has to be checked.</li><li>The field <i class="field">Delay time</i> is set to an AnyLogic Java expression corresponding to the activity's duration value: <i>triangular(10, 30, 15)</i>.</li></ol></li></ol><p>The result of these model implementation steps is shown in the following AnyLogic process diagram:</p><figure id="PizzaService-AnyLogic__lof__64"><img alt="???" height="185" src="_res/AnyLogic-Make-and-Deliver-Pizza-Screenshot.png" width="741" /><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-5</span>. </span>An AnyLogic process diagram for the Make-and-Deliver-Pizza business process.</figcaption></figure><p>Notice that for measuring the cycle time of <i>MakePizza</i> activities, the corresponding processing node is included in a <i>TimeMeasureStart-TimeMeasureEnd</i> pair of time measurement nodes (<i>startTime</i> and <i>endTime</i>). </p><blockquote class="role-attention"><p>Unfortunately, PN modeling tools, like AnyLogic, do not support the general concept of activities (and Activity Networks), but only the special concept of <em>processing activities</em>. A processing activity has a <em>processing object</em> (&quot;entity&quot;) as a mandatory participant, in addition to resource objects. While in a PN model, processing nodes do have a location and a <em>processing capacity</em> (the number of processing objects that can be processed in parallel), the nodes of an Activity Network (like the Make-and-Deliver-Pizza model), representing pure activities, in general do neither have a processing capacity nor a location.</p><p>For instance, in the AnyLogic Make-and-Deliver-Pizza model above, &quot;orders&quot; are processing objects and the processing activity <i>TakeOrder</i> is performed at the processing node <i>TakeOrder</i> by a pizza maker that is processing an &quot;order&quot;. Consequently, the <i>TakeOrder</i>, <i>MakePizza</i> and <i>DeliverPizza</i> elements in the AnyLogic process diagram do not represent activities, but rather processing nodes. </p></blockquote><details open="open"><summary>Implementing the Enriched Process Design Model with AnyLogic</summary></details></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-previous"><a href="Make-and-Deliver-Pizza-OESjs.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-previous-icon" title="Previous page
