The ES paradigm has been pioneered by <em>SIMSCRIPT</em> (<a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2009/RM3310.pdf">Markowitz, Hausner &amp; Karr 1962</a>) and later formalized by <em>Event Graphs</em> (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358460">Schruben 1983</a>).</p><p>According to Pegden, in ES, the system under investigation is viewed as a series of instantaneous events that change its state over time. The modeler “defines the events in the system and models the state changes that take place when those events occur”. More precisely, the modeler defines the <i>types</i> of events that cause <i>state changes</i> and/or <i>follow-up events</i>.</p><p>Pegden also explains that in ES,</p><ol><li>a simulation creates events that are supposed to occur in the future (called <i>future events</i>),</li><li>future events are scheduled (using an <i>event scheduling</i> mechanism),</li><li>time advances to the time of the next event (<i>next-event time progression</i>),</li><li>the series of events corresponds to a sequence of state transitions of a <i>transition system</i> where the “transition logic” of each event type is specified in the form of a procedure definition (often called <i>event routine</i>).</li></ol><p>Event routines can be expressed at an abstract level, e.g., using pseudo code as in (<a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/019.pdf">Pegden 2010</a>), or in a simulation or programming language. In an object-oriented approach, it is natural to define an event routine as a method of the class defining the event type.</p><p>Pegden does not make any attempt to clarify the philosophical nature of (types of) events and their “transition logic”. Philosophically, (1) all events have <i>participants</i>, which are the objects that participate in them; (2) the combination of an <em>event type</em> and its <i>event routine</i> amounts to an <b><i>event rule</i></b> of the form </p><p class="indented"><b>ON</b> <i>event</i> <b>DO</b> <i>procedure</i></p><p>Basic Object Event Simulation (OES) extends ES, or Event Graphs, by adding the modeling concepts of <em>objects</em> and <em>event rules</em>.</p></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-previous"><a href="secProcesses.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-previous-icon" title="Previous page
