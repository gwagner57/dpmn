Modeling and Simulation of Organizations and Business Processes with DPMN

Organizations are complex social systems with many actors performing various activities in multiple business processes. 
At a basic level, organizations are Discrete Dynamic Systems consisting of objects and events, connected via causal regularities.
As such, they can be described with an Object Event Modeling (OEM) approach, using UML Class Diagrams for state structure modeling
and the Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation (DPMN) for process modeling. In particular, their business processes can
be modeled in the form of a DPMN Process Diagram defining a set of event rules capturing causal regularities. The resulting 
model defines a set of object types, event types, and event rules, which form an Abstract State Machine providing the execution
semantics of OEM and DPMN. Like Petri Nets, OEM has a formal semantics. But while Petrie Nets are an abstract formalism 
without an ontological semantics, OEM is based on the ontological categories of objects, events and causal regularities.
We argue that OEM/DPMN form a good basis for exploring the semantics of higher-level organizational concepts, such as norms and goals.

Points to make

- why is it better to develop a simulation modeling language, instead of just a modeling language, for modeling organizations
- before we can investigate agent-oriented modeling we first need to
