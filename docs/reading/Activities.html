It combines the intuitive flowchart modeling style of BPMN with the rigorous semantics provided by the event scheduling arrows of Event Graphs and the event rules of the Object Event Modeling and Simulation paradigm. A DPMN model has a formal semantics in terms of an Abstract State Machine whose state structure is defined by an object-oriented signature and whose transitions are defined by event rules capturing causal regularities." name="og:description" /><meta content="https://dpmn.info/" name="og:url" /><meta content="https://dpmn.info/img/DPMN.png" name="og:image" /><meta content="summary_large_image" name="twitter:card" /><style>/*<![CDATA[*/

The state structure of a system is captured by a UML Class Diagram, which defines the types of objects, events and activities underlying a DPMN Process Diagram that captures the dynamics of the system in the form of a set of <em>event rules</em>. Part I of the tutorial presents the <em>Object Event Modeling (OEM)</em> paradigm and a basic OEM approach for modeling discrete event simulations based on Objects and Events with UML Class Diagrams and DPMN Process Diagrams. In this second part, the basic OEM approach is extended by considering <em>Activities</em> and <em>Processing Networks</em>. Part III will show how to add the modeling concepts of Agents with Perceptions, Actions and Beliefs, resulting in a general agent-based Discrete Event Simulation modeling framework.</p></div></div><div class="role-frontmatter" id="frontmatter"><section class="role-toc" id="toc"><h1 class="role-toc-title">Table of Contents</h1><ul class="role-booklist-entries"><li

<span class="role-number">1</span>. </span>Introduction</h1><p>Object Event (OE) Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) is a new general Discrete Event Simulation (DES) paradigm based on the idea that both <em>conceptual models</em> for DES and <em>DES design models</em> consist of (1) an <em>information model</em> and (2) a <em>process model</em>. </p><p>In the case of conceptual modeling, an information model describes the types of objects and events representing the main entities of the real-world system under investigation, while a process model describes its dynamics in the form of a set of <em>conceptual event rule models</em> that capture the <em>causal regularities</em> of the system. </p><p>In the case of simulation design modeling, an <em>information design model</em> prescribes (defines) the types of all objects and events that are relevant for the purpose of a simulation study, thus defining the state structure of a DES system, while a <em>process design model</em> defines the dynamics of a DES system by defining, for all event types of the underlying information model, an <em>event rule design model</em> that specifies the state changes and follow-up events implied by the occurrence of an event of that type. </p><p>In the first part of this article series, (<a href="#Bibliography__Wagner2018b">Wagner 2018b</a>), we have introduced a variant of the <em>Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)</em>, called <em>Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation (DPMN)</em>, and have shown how to use UML Class Diagrams and DPMN Process Diagrams for making basic OE models defining a set of object types <i>OT</i>, a set of event types <i>ET</i>, and a set of event rules <i>R</i>. In (Wagner 2017a), we have shown that (a) these three sets define a state transition system, where the state space is defined by <i>OT</i> and <i>ET</i>, and the transitions are defined by <i>R</i>, and (b) such a transition system represents an <em>Abstract State Machine</em> in the sense of Gurevich (1985). This fundamental characterization of an OE model provides a formal (operational) semantics for OE Simulation (OES) by defining an <em>OES formalism</em> that any OE simulator has to implement.</p><p>In this second part, we extend basic OEM/DPMN in two steps by adding support for <em>activities</em> and for GPSS/SIMAN/Arena-style <em>Processing Networks (PNs)</em>. <em>Processing objects</em> enter PNs via <em>arrival events</em> at an <em>entry node</em> and then flow through one or more <em>processing nodes</em> where they are subject to <em>processing activities</em> before they leave the system at an <em>exit node</em> via a <em>departure event</em>. The first extension, OEM/DPMN-A, comprises five new information modeling categories (&quot;stereotypes&quot;) and one new process modeling element, while the second extension, OEM/DPMN-PN, comprises a set of four pre-defined object types and three pre-defined event types, three new (node type) categories and one new process modeling element, as listed in tables in <a class="role-section1-ref" href="#Appendix">Appendix A: OEM Elements</a>.</p><section class="role-section1" id="IntroExample"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.1</span>. </span>Object Event Modeling</h2><p>As an example for illustrating basic OEM&amp;S, as introduced in Part I (Wagner 2018b), we present a simple OE model of a manufacturing workstation that receives parts and stores them in its input buffer for processing them successively. Such a model consists of (1) a <em>conceptual model</em> describing the real-world domain, and (2) a <em>simulation design model</em> prescribing a certain computational solution for the purpose of a simulation study. Both conceptual models and design models consist of an <em>information model</em> describing/defining the system's <em>state structure</em> and a <em>process model</em> describing/defining the system's <em>dynamics</em>. An information design model defines the object and event types for a corresponding process design model. </p><section><h4>Conceptual Model</h4><p>A conceptual information model of a workstation system, defining two object types and four event types, is shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#IntroExample__figWS_CIM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-1</span></span></a>.</p><figure id="IntroExample__figWS_CIM"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-1</span>. </span>A conceptual information model of a manufacturing workstation system</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="Activities_files/WS_CIM.svg" /></div></figure><p>As expressed by the associations between the four event types and the two object types, for all four types of events, there are the same two types of objects participating in them: parts and workstations, implying that each event of these four types involves a specific part and a specific workstation.</p><p>Notice that the input buffer (filled with waiting parts) is modeled as an association end with name <em>waiting parts</em> at the <em>parts</em> side of the association between <em>parts</em> and <em>workstations</em>, expressing the fact that at any point in time, a workstation has zero or more parts waiting in its input buffer for being processed.</p><p>A conceptual process model of this system, describing four <em>causal regularities</em> in the form of <em>event rules</em>, one for each type of event, is shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#IntroExample__figWS_CPM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-2</span></span></a> in the form of a <em>BPMN Process Diagram</em> using Event circles connected with Sequence Flow arrows expressing (conditional) causation, and Data Objects attached to Event circles.</p><figure id="IntroExample__figWS_CPM"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-2</span>. </span>A conceptual process model of a manufacturing workstation system</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="Activities_files/WS_CPM.svg" /></div></figure><p>The four event rules described by this model are</p><ol><li>When a part arrives, it is added to the input buffer and, if the workstation is available, there will be a processing start event for processing the newly arrived part.</li><li>When a processing start event occurs, the next part from the input buffer isl being processed and a processing end event is caused to occur some time later (after the processing time has elapsed).</li><li>When a processing end event occurs, this will cause a part departure event and, if the input buffer is not empty, another processing start event involving the next part from the buffer.</li><li>When a part departure event occurs, the processed part will be removed from the workstation.</li></ol></section><section><h4>Design Model</h4><p>A simulation design model is based on a conceptual model. Depending on the purposes/goals of a simulation study, it may abstract away from certain elements of the real-world domain described by the conceptual model, and it adds computational elements representing design decisions, such as <em>random variables</em> expressed int he form of random variate sampling functions based on specific probability distributions for modeling the random variation of certain system variables.</p><p>An information design model of the single workstation system described above is shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#IntroExample__figWS2_IDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-3</span></span></a>. This model defines the multi-valued <code>waitingParts</code> association end to be ordered, which means that it corresponds to a multi-valued reference property holding an ordered collection (such as an array list or a queue) as its value. </p><p>The information design model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#IntroExample__figWS2_IDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-3</span></span></a> defines that a <i>PartArrival</i> event must reference both a <i>Part</i> and a <i>WorkStation</i>, representing situations where specific parts arrive at specific workstations. Notice that, computationally, this model requires creating new <i>Part</i> objects (or retrieving them from an object pool) before a new <i>PartArrival</i> event is created (or scheduled), while it is more common in simulation models to create a new <i>Part</i> object only when an arrival event has occurred, which can be modeled by defining a multiplicity of 0..1 for the <i>Part</i> end of the <i>PartArrival</i>-<i>Part</i> association (with the meaning that <i>PartArrival</i> has an optional, instead of a mandatory, reference property with name <i>part</i>).</p><figure id="IntroExample__figWS2_IDM"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-3</span>. </span>An information design model</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="Activities_files/WS2_IDM.svg" /></div></figure><p>Notice that the model defines two class level operations (designated with the stereotype «rv») implementing random variate sampling functions: <code>PartArrival::recurrence()</code> complies with a triangular probability distribution with minimum, mode and maximum parameter values 3, 4 and 8, while <code>ProcessingStart::processingTime()</code> complies with an exponential distribution with an event rate parameter value of 6.</p><p>A process design model based on the object and event types defined by the information design model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#IntroExample__figWS2_IDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-3</span></span></a> and derived from the conceptual process model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#IntroExample__figWS_CPM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-2</span></span></a> is shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#IntroExample__figWS2_PDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-4</span></span></a>.</p><figure id="IntroExample__figWS2_PDM"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-4</span>. </span>A process design model in the form of a DPMN Process Diagram</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="Activities_files/WS2_PDM.svg" /></div></figure><p>Notice that, since all events happen at the same workstation, all three event scheduling arrows are annotated with the same event property assignment <code>workStation := ws</code>, which simply propagates the object reference to the given workstation along the event scheduling chain. Such property propagation assignments (in event property assignment annotations), where a property value of a follow-up event is set to the corresponding property value of the scheduling (or triggering) event, will be omitted (as implied by event types having the same property names) for avoiding to clutter the process model diagrams.</p><p>A DPMN Process Diagram, like the one shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#IntroExample__figWS2_PDM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-4</span></span></a>, can be split up into a set of event rule diagrams, one for each of its Event circles, as shown in the following table. This reduction of a DPMN process design model to a set of event rule design models, together with the operational semantics of event rules presented in (Wagner 2017a), provides the semantics of DPMN Process Diagrams. </p><p>Notice that an event rule design model can also be expressed textually in the form of a pseudo-code block with four parts: part 1 indicates the triggering event type and declares a rule variable representing the triggering event, part 2 declares further rule variables and initializes them, part 3 contains a state change script consisting of state change statements, and part 4 schedules follow-up events.</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th>Rule design model</th><th>Pseudo-code</th></tr><tr><td><img src="Activities_files/WS2_RDM_PartArrival.svg" /></td><td><table border="1"><thead><tr><th>ON a:PartArrival</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ws : WorkStation<br />ws := a.workStation</td></tr><tr><td>ws.waitingParts.push( a.part)</td></tr><tr><td>IF ws.status = AVAILABLE <br />THEN SCHEDULE ProcessingStart( workStation:=ws)</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><img src="Activities_files/WS2_RDM_ProcStart.svg" /></td><td><table border="1"><thead><tr><th>ON ps:ProcessingStart</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ws : WorkStation<br />ws := ps.workStation</td></tr><tr><td>ws.status := BUSY</td></tr><tr><td>SCHEDULE ProcessingEnd( workStation:=ws) <br />DELAYED BY ProcessingStart.processingTime()</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><img src="Activities_files/WS2_RDM_ProcEnd.svg" /></td><td><table border="1"><thead><tr><th>ON pe:ProcessingEnd</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ws : WorkStation<br />ws := pe.workStation</td></tr><tr><td>ws.waitingParts.pop()<br />IF ws.waitingParts.length = 0 <br />THEN ws.status := AVAILABLE</td></tr><tr><td>IF ws.waitingParts.length &gt; 0 <br />THEN SCHEDULE ProcessingStart( workStation:=ws)</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></section></section><section class="role-section1" id="OntologicalConsiderations"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.2</span>. </span>Ontological Considerations</h2><p>Ontologically, an <strong>activity</strong> is a composite event (composed of at least a start and an end event) with a duration greater than zero, performed by an agent (a human or another living being, a robot or another artificial agent, or an organization or another social agent). As opposed to activities, activity start and end events are <em>instantaneous</em> (zero-duration) events. </p><p>As an event, an activity has objects that <em>participate</em> in it. In the real world, an activity has at least one participant: the <em>performer</em> of the activity. Consequently, a conceptual model should, for each activity type, include the type of objects that play the performer role for activities of that type, as described by the model shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#OntologicalConsiderations__figCoreOntology"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-5</span></span></a>.</p><figure id="OntologicalConsiderations__figCoreOntology"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-5</span>. </span>An ontology of the core categories of individuals of the OEM&amp;S paradigm</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="Activities_files/Individuals-Ontology.svg" /></div></figure><p>However, in a simulation design model we may leave the performer of an activity implicit and model an activity without modeling any participant. Consequently, a basic <em>OE</em> simulator, the core classes of which are described in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secOES__figActIsEvt"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-6</span></span></a>, does not need to support the distinction between objects and agents.</p><p>A <strong>discrete process</strong> (instance) consists of a partially ordered set of events that happen in a coherent spatio-temporal region determined by the events' participants and the causal regularities involved. When two or more events within a process have the same order rank, this means that they occur simultaneously. </p><p>A <strong>business process</strong> (instance) is a discrete process that happens in the context of an <em>organization</em>. Typically, a business process is an instance of a business process type defined by an organization (or organizational unit), which is the owner of the business process type, in the form of a process model. Notice that this concept includes business system processes, where many business actors perform activities for handling many business cases in parallel. Consequently, it is more general than the common concept of a business process as a case-handling process. </p></section><section class="role-section1" id="secOES"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.3</span>. </span>Object Event Simulation</h2><p>The Object Event Simulation (OES) paradigm is based on the idea of executing an OE model starting with an initial simulation state by successively applying the event rules of the model to the evolving simulation states.</p><figure id="secOES__figActIsEvt"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-6</span>. </span>A model of the core classes of individuals an OE simulator has to deal with at runtime.</figcaption><div><img alt="core class model for object event simulators" src="Activities_files/Activity-isA-Event.svg" width="450" /></div></figure><p>Notice that the <em>occurrence time</em> of an activity is the time when it completes, that is, it is equal to <i>startTime</i> + <i>duration</i>. Typically, the duration of an activity in a simulation run is known, and set, when it is started. An activity type is normally defined with a fixed duration or a random variable duration for all activities of that type. This allows a simulator to schedule the activity's end event when the activity is started. However, in certain cases, an activity type may not define a preset duration, but leave the duration of activities of that type open. When such an activity is still ongoing, it does only have a start time, but no duration and no occurrence time.</p><section><h4>The OES formalism</h4><p>The OEM&amp;S paradigm is based on the OES formalism presented in (Wagner 2017a), which is summarized below. </p>Both <em>object types</em> and <em>event types</em> are defined in the form of classes: with a name, a set of properties and a set of operations, which together define their signature. A <em>property</em> is essentially defined by a name and a <em>range</em>, which is either a datatype (like Integer or String) or another object type.<p>A set of object types <i>OT</i> defines a <em>predicate-logical signature</em> as the basis of a logical expression language <i>L<sub>OT</sub></i>: each object type defines a unary predicate, and its properties define binary predicates. A state change language <i>C<sub>OT</sub></i> based on <i>OT</i> defines state change statements expressed with the help of the object type names and property names defined by <i>OT</i>. In the simplest case, state change statements are property value assignments like <i>o</i>.p<sub>1</sub> := 4 or <i>o</i>.p<sub>1</sub> := <i>o</i>.p<sub>2</sub> where <i>o</i> is an object variable and p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub> are property names.</p><p>A set of objects <i><u>O</u></i> = {o<sub>1</sub>, o<sub>2</sub>, ...o<sub>n</sub>} where each of them has a state in the form of a set of <em>slots</em> (property-value pairs) represents a <em>system state</em>, that is a state of the real-world system being modeled and simulated. A system state <i><u>O</u></i> can be updated by a set of state changes (or, more precisely, state change statements) <i>Δ</i> ⊆ <i>C<sub>OT</sub></i> with the help of an update operation Upd. For instance, for a system state <i><u>O</u></i><sub>1</sub> = {o<sub>1</sub>} with o<sub>1</sub> = { p<sub>1</sub>: 2, p<sub>2</sub>: 5} and a set of state changes <i>Δ</i><sub>1</sub> = { o<sub>1</sub>.p<sub>1</sub> := o<sub>1</sub>.p<sub>2</sub> } we obtain</p><div style="text-align:center;">Upd<i>( <u>O</u></i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Δ</i><sub>1</sub>) = {{ p<sub>1</sub>: 5, p<sub>2</sub>: 5}}</div><p>An <i>event expression</i> is a term E<i>(<u>x</u>)@t</i> where</p><ol><li>E is an event type,</li><li><i><u>x</u></i> is a (possibly empty) list of event parameters <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, …, <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> according to the signature of the event type E,</li><li><i>t</i> is a parameter for the occurrence time of events.</li></ol><p>For instance, PartArrival(<i>ws</i>)@<i>t</i> is an event expression for describing part arrival events where the event parameter <i>ws</i> is of type WorkStation, and <i>t</i> denotes the arrival time. An individual event of type E is a <i>ground</i> event expression, <i>e</i> = E(<i><u>v</u></i>)@<i>i</i>, where the event parameter list <i><u>x</u></i> and the occurrence time parameter <i>t</i> have been instantiated with a corresponding value list <i><u>v</u></i> and a specific time instant <i>i</i>. For instance, PartArrival(ws1)@1 is a ground event expression representing an individual PartArrival event occurring at workstation ws1 at time 1.</p>A <em>Future Events List (FEL)</em> is a set of ground event expressions partially ordered by their occurrence times, which represent future time instants either from a discrete or a continuous model of time. The partial order implies the possibility of simultaneous events, as in the example {ProcessingEnd(ws1)@4, PartArrival(ws1)@4}.<p>An <i>event routine</i> is a procedure that essentially computes state changes and follow-up events, possibly based on conditions on the current state. In practice, state changes are often directly performed by immediately updating the objects concerned, and follow-up events are immediately scheduled by adding them to the FEL. For the OES formalism, we assume that an event routine is a pure function that computes state changes and follow-up events, but does not apply them, as illustrated by the examples in the following table.</p><table border="1" id="secOES__tblEvtRules"><colgroup style="text-align:center;"></colgroup><colgroup></colgroup><colgroup></colgroup><thead><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"><p><b>Event rule name / rule variables</b></p></td><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>ON (event expression)</b></p></td><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>DO (event routine)</b></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>r<i><sub>PA</sub> </i></p><p><i>a</i>: PartArrival<i><br />ws</i>: WorkStation<br /><i>ws</i> := <i>a</i>.workStation</p></td><td><p>PartArrival(<i>ws</i>) @ <i>t</i></p></td><td><p><i>Δ</i> := { <i>ws</i>.waitingParts.push( <i>a</i>.part)}<br /></p><p>IF <i>ws</i>.status = AVAILABLE <br />THEN <i>FE</i> := {ProcessingStart(<i>ws</i>)@<i>t</i>+1}<br />ELSE <i>FE</i> := {}</p><p>RETURN ⟨ <i>Δ</i>, <i>FE</i> ⟩</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>r<i><sub>PS</sub></i> </p><i>ps</i>: ProcessingStart<i><br />ws</i>: WorkStation<br /><i>ws</i> := <i>ps</i>.workStation</td><td><p>ProcessingStart(<i>ws</i>) @ <i>t</i></p></td><td><p><i>Δ</i> := { ws.status := BUSY}</p><p><i>FE</i> := {ProcessingEnd(<i>ws</i>)@<i>t + ProcessingStart.processingTime()</i>}</p><p>RETURN ⟨ <i>Δ</i>, <i>FE</i> ⟩ </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>r<i><sub>PE</sub></i> </p><i>pe</i>: ProcessingEnd<i><br />ws</i>: WorkStation<br /><i>ws</i> := <i>pe</i>.workStation</td><td><p>ProcessingEnd(<i>ws</i>) @ <i>t</i></p></td><td><p><i>Δ</i> := { ws.waitingParts.pop()}<br />IF ws.waitingParts.length = 0 <br />THEN <i>Δ</i> := <i>Δ</i> ∪ {ws.status := AVAILABLE}</p><p>IF ws.waitingParts.length &gt; 0 <br />THEN <i>FE</i> := { ProcessingStart(<i>ws</i>)@<i>t</i>+1}<br />ELSE <i>FE</i> := {}</p><p>RETURN ⟨ <i>Δ</i>, <i>FE</i> ⟩ </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>An <b><i>event rule</i></b> associates an event expression with an <i>event routine F</i>:</p><div style="text-align:center;"><b>ON</b> E<i>(<u>x</u>)@t</i> <b>DO</b> <i>F( t, <u>x</u>)</i>,</div><p>where the event expression E<i>(<u>x</u>)@t</i> specifies the type E of events that trigger the rule, and <i>F( t, <u>x</u>)</i> is a function call expression for computing a set of <i>state changes</i> and a set of <i>follow-up events</i>, based on the event parameter values <i><u>x</u></i>, the event's occurrence time <i>t</i> and the current system state, which is accessed in the event routine <i>F</i> for testing conditions expressed in terms of state variables.</p><p>An <em>OE model</em> based on a state change language <i>C<sub>OT</sub></i> and a corresponding update operation Upd is a triple ⟨<i>OT, ET, R</i>⟩, consisting of a set of object types <i>OT</i>, event types <i>ET</i> and event rules <i>R</i>.</p>An <em>OE</em> <i>simulation (system) state</i> based on an OE model ⟨<i>OT, ET, R</i>⟩ is a triple <i>S</i> = ⟨<i>t, <u>O</u>, <u>E</u></i>⟩ with <i>t</i> being the current simulation time, <i><u>O</u></i> being a <em>system state</em> (a set of objects instantiating types from <i>OT</i>), and <i><u>E</u></i> being a set of <em>imminent</em> events to occur at times greater than <i>t</i> (and instantiating types from <i>ET</i>), also called <em>Future Event List (FEL)</em>.<p>An event rule <i>r</i> = <b>ON</b> E<i>(<u>x</u>)@t</i> <b>DO</b> <i>F( t, <u>x</u>)</i> can be considered as a 2-step function that, in the first step, maps an event <i>e</i> = E(<i><u>v</u></i>)@<i>i</i> to a parameter-free state change function <i>r<sub>e</sub></i> = <i>F( i, <u>v</u>)</i>, which maps a system state <i><u>O</u></i> to a pair ⟨ <i>Δ</i>, <i>FE</i> ⟩ of system state changes <i>Δ</i> ⊆ <i>C<sub>OT</sub></i> and follow-up events <i>FE</i>. When the parameters <i>t</i> and<i> <u>x</u></i> of <i>F( t, <u>x</u>)</i> are replaced by the values <i>i</i> and <i><u>v</u></i> provided by a ground event expression E(<i><u>v</u></i>)@<i>i</i>, we also simply write <i>F<sub>i,<u>v</u></sub></i> instead of <i>F( i, <u>v</u>)</i> for the resulting parameter-free state change function.</p><p>We say that an event rule <i>r</i> is <i>triggered</i> by an event <i>e</i> when the event's type is the same as the rule's event type.

For instance, while BPMN allows assigning resources to activities, it does not allow modeling resource pools (see <a href="#secCM-2__secResPools"></a>), and does neither allow specifying resource cardinality constraints nor parallel participation multiplicity constraints (see <a href="#secCM-2__secNonExclusiveRes"></a>).</p><p>In the DES paradigm of Processing Networks, Gordon (1961) has introduced the resource management operations <em>Seize</em> and <em>Release</em> in the simulation language GPSS for allocating and de-allocating (releasing) resources. Thus, GPSS has established a standard modeling pattern for resource-constrained activities, which has become popular under the name of <em>Seize</em>-<em>Delay</em>-<em>Release</em> indicating that for simulating a resource-constrained activity, its resources are first allocated, and then, after some delay (representing the duration of the simulated activity), they are de-allocated (released).</p><section><h4>Resource roles and process owners</h4><p>As an illustrative example, we consider a hospital consisting of medical departments where patients arrive for getting a medical examination performed by a doctor in a room of the department. A medical examination, as an activity, has four participants: a patient, a medical department, a doctor and a room, but only two of them play a resource role: doctors and rooms. This can be indicated in an OEM class diagram by using the stereotype «resource role» for categorizing the association ends that represent resource roles, as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figResRoles"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-3</span></span></a>.</p><figure id="secCM-2__figResRoles"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-3</span>. </span>A conceptual information model of the activity type &quot;examinations&quot; with resource roles.</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="Activities_files/MedExam_CM1.svg" /></div></figure><p>Notice that both the event type <em>patient arrivals</em> and the activity type <em>examinations</em> have a (mandatory functional) reference property <em>process owner</em>. This implies that both patient arrival events and examination activities happen at a specific medical department, which is their process owner in the sense that it owns the process types composed of them. A process owner is called &quot;Participant&quot; in BPMN (in the sense of a collaboration participant) and visually rendered in the form of a container rectangle called &quot;Pool&quot;.</p><p>In <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figResRoles"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-3</span></span></a>, the resource role of doctors is designated as the <em>performer</em> role. Also in BPMN, <em>Performer</em> is considered to be a special type of resource role. According to (BPMN 2011), a performer can be &quot;a specific individual, a group, an organization role or position, or an organization&quot;.<a class="role-footnote-ref" href="#__FN1" id="__FNR1">[1]</a>In BPMN, the performer role is specialized into the <em>HumanPerformer</em> of an activity, which is, in turn, specialized into <em>PotentialOwner</em> denoting the &quot;persons who can claim and work&quot; on an activity of a given type. &quot;A potential owner becomes the actual owner [...] by explicitly claiming&quot; an activity. Assigning a human resource to an activity by leaving the choice to those humans that play a suitable resource role is characteristic for workflow management, but it ignores the case where a human resource is assigned to a task (as its performer) by the process owner. </p><p>One of the main reasons for considering certain objects as resources is the need to collect <em>utilization statistics</em> (either in an operational information system, like a workflow management system, or in a simulation model) by recording the use of resources over time (their <em>utilization</em>) per activity type. By designating resource roles in information models, these models provide the information needed in simulations and information systems for automatically collect utilization statistics.</p></section><section id="secCM-2__secResPools"><h4>Resource pools and resource allocation</h4><p>In the hospital example, a medical department, as the process owner, is the organizational unit that is responsible for reacting to certain events (here: patient arrivals) and managing the performance of certain processes and activities (here: medical examinations), including the allocation of resources to these processes and activities. For being able to allocate resources to activities, a process owner needs to manage <em>resource pools</em>, normally one for each resource role of each type of activity (if pools are not shared among resource roles). A resource pool is a collection of resource objects of a certain type. For instance, the three X-ray rooms of a diagnostic imaging department form a resource pool of that department.</p><p>Resource pools can be modeled in an OEM class diagram by means of special associations between object classes representing process owners (like <em>medical departments</em>) and resource classes (like <em>doctors</em> and <em>rooms</em>), where the association ends, corresponding to collection-valued properties representing resource pools, are stereotyped with «resource pool», as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figResPools"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-4</span></span></a>.

For instance, in the model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figResPools"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-4</span></span></a>, a medical department has the procedures &quot;allocate a doctor&quot; and &quot;allocate a room&quot; for allocating a doctor and a room to a medical examination. These resource allocation procedures may use various policies, especially for allocating human resources, such as first determining the suitability of potential resources (e.g., based on expertise, experience and previous performance), then ranking them and finally selecting from the most suitable ones (at random or based on their turn).

Such a simplification may be justified if the walking time can be neglected or if there is no need to maximize the productive utilization of doctors who, according to this process model, have to wait until the patient arrives at the room. Below, this model is extended for allowing to allocate rooms and doctors in a decoupled manner such that patients have to wait for doctors, and not the other way around. </p></section><section><h4>Switching roles: doctors as patients</h4><p>The same person who is a doctor at a diagnostic imaging department may be treated as a patient of that department. It's a well-known fact that in the real world people may switch roles and may play several roles at the same time, but many modeling approaches/platforms fail to admit this. For instance, the simulation language (SIMAN) of the well-known DES modeling tool Arena does not treat resources and processing objects (&quot;entities&quot;) as roles, but as strictly separate categories. This language design decision was a meta-modeling mistake, as admitted by Denis Pegden, the main creator of SIMAN/Arena, in (Drogoul et al 2018) where he says &quot;it was a conceptualization mistake to view Entities and Resources as different constructs&quot;. </p><p>In <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figKindsRoles"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-6</span></span></a>, the above model is extended by categorizing the classes <i>doctors</i> and <i>patients</i> as «role type» classes and adding the «kind» class <i>people</i> as a supertype of <i>doctors</i> and <i>patients</i>, we create the possibility that a person may play both roles: the role of a doctor and the role of a patient, albeit not at the same time. The object type categories «kind» and «role type» have been introduced to conceptual modeling by Guizzardi (2005).</p><figure id="secCM-2__figKindsRoles"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-6</span>. </span>A conceptual information model with doctors and patients as people.</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="Activities_files/MedExam_CM3.svg" /></div></figure></section><section><h4>Queueing planned activities</h4><p>Whenever an activity is to be performed but cannot start due to a required resource not being available, the <em>planned activity</em> is placed in a queue as a waiting job. Thus, in the case of a medical examination of a patient, as described in the model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figKindsRoles"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-6</span></span></a>, the <em>waiting line</em> represents, in fact, a queue of planned examinations (involving patients), and not a queue of waiting patients. </p><p>This consideration points to a general issue: modeling resource-constrained activities implies modeling queues of planned activities, while there is no need to consider (physical) queues of (physical) objects. Consequently, even if a real-world system includes a physical queue (of physical objects), an OEM-A model may abstract away from its physical character and consider it as a queue of planned activities (possibly including pre-allocated resources). While a physical queue implies that there is a maximum capacity, a queue of planned activities does not imply this. For instance, when a medical department does not require patients to queue up in a waiting area for obtaining an examination, but accepts their registration for an examination by phone, the resulting queue of waiting patients is not a physical queue (but rather a queue of planned examinations) and there is no need to limit the number of waiting patients in the same way as in the case of queuing up in a waiting area with limited space.</p><p>A planned activity can only start, when all required resources have been allocated to it. Thus, a planned examination of a patient can only start, when both a room and a doctor have been allocated to it. Let's assume that when a patient <i>p</i> arrives, only a room is available, but not a doctor. In that case, the available room is allocated to the planned examination, which is then placed in a queue since it still has to wait for the availability of a doctor. Only when a doctor becomes available, e.g., via the completion of an examination of another patient or via an arrival of a doctor, the doctor can be allocated as the last resource needed to start the planned examination of patient <i>p</i>. </p><p>As a consequence of these considerations, the <em>waiting line</em> of a medical department modeled in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figKindsRoles"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-6</span></span></a> as an ordered collection of patients is renamed to <em>planned walks</em> in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figMedDepCIM4"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-7</span></span></a>. In addition, a property <em>planned examinations</em>, which holds an ordered collection of patient-room pairs, is added to the class <em>medical departments</em>.

This approach allows introducing new DPMN modeling elements for expressing the Allocate-Release Modeling Pattern in a concise way, either leaving allocate-release steps completely implicit, as in the DPMN Process Diagram of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secAllocateReleasePattern__figAllocRelPatternPDM2"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-23</span></span></a>, or explicitly expressing them, as in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secAllocateReleasePattern__figAllocRelPatternPDM1"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-24</span></span></a>.</p><p>The most important new DPMN modeling element introduced are <em>resource-dependent causation (</em>resp., <em>event flow</em>) arrows pointing to resource-constrained activities, as in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secAllocateReleasePattern__figAllocRelPatternPDM2"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-23</span></span></a>.

The fact that, using <em>resource-dependent event flow</em> arrows, the allocate-release logic of resource-constrained activities does not have to be explicitly modeled and displayed in an OEM process model shows the power of founding a process model on an information model, since the entire resource management logic can be expressed in terms of resource roles, constraints and pools in an OEM information model. This is in contrast to the common approach of industrial simulation tools, such as Simio and AnyLogic, which require defining resource roles, constraints and pools as well as explicit allocate-release steps in the process model, in a similar way as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secAllocateReleasePattern__figAllocRelPatternPDM1"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-24</span></span></a>.</p><p>Using resource-dependent scheduling arrows in a process model implies using their standard allocate-release logic according to which required resources that have not been allocated before are allocated immediately before an activity requiring them is started and released immediately after this activity is completed if they are not required by the next activity. Whenever another (non-standard) resource allocation logic is needed, it has to be expressed explicitly using ordinary event scheduling arrows.</p></section><section><h4>Simplifying the workstation process model</h4><p>We can now simplify the workstation model using the resource type category for <i>WorkStation</i> in the OEM class model and a resource-dependent event flow arrow from the arrival event to the processing activity in the DPMN process model.

Consequently, OEM-PN models are spatial simulation models, while basic OEM and OEM-A allow to abstract away from space. When processing objects are routed to a follow-up processing activity, they move to the location of the next processing node. The underlying space model allows visualizing a PN simulation in a natural way with processing objects as moving objects.</p><p>Each node in a PN model represents both an object and an event type. An Entry Node represents both an entry point (e.g., a reception area or an entrance to an inventory) and an arrival event type. A Processing Node represents both a resource object (e.g., a workstation or a room) and a processing activity type. An Exit Node represents both an exit point and a departure event type. A flow arrow connecting two Processing Nodes represents both an event flow and an object flow. Thus, the node types and the flow arrows of a PN are high-level modeling concepts that are overloaded with two meanings.</p><p>A PN modeling language should have elements for modeling each of the three types of nodes. Consequently, DPMN-A has to be extended by adding new visual modeling elements for entry, processing and exit nodes, and for connecting them.</p><p>In the field of DES, PNs have often been characterized by the narrative of “entities flowing through a system”. In fact, while in basic DPMN and in DPMN-A, there is only a flow of events, in DPMN-PN this flow of events is over-laid with a flow of (processing) objects.</p><p>PNs have been investigated in <em>operations management</em> and the mathematical theory of queuing (Loch 1998, Williams 2016) and have been the application focus of most industrial simulation software products, historically starting with GPSS (Gordon 1961) and SIMAN/Arena (Pegden and Davis 1992). They allow modeling many forms of discrete <i>processing processes</i> as can be found, for instance, in the manufacturing industry and the services industry.</p><p>It is remarkable that the PN paradigm has dominated the discrete event simulation market since the 1990’s and still flourishes today, mainly in the manufacturing and services industries, often with object-oriented and “agent-based” extensions. Its dominance has led many simulation experts to view it as a synonym of DES, which is a conceptual flaw because the concept of DES, even if not precisely defined, is clearly more general than the PN paradigm.</p><p>The PN paradigm has often been called a “process-oriented” DES approach. But unlike the business process modeling language BPMN, it is not concerned with a general concept of <i>business process models</i>, but rather with the special class of <i>processing process models</i> for discrete processing systems. A processing process includes the simultaneous handling of several “cases” (processing objects) that may compete for resources or have other interdependencies, while a “business process” in Business Process Management has traditionally been considered as a case-based process that is isolated from other cases.</p><p>For PN models, a simulator can automatically collect the following statistics, in addition to the resource-constrained activities statistics described in <a class="role-chapter-ref" href="#index-3"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">3</span>. </span>Resource-Constrained Activities</a>:</p><ol><li>The number of processing objects that arrived at, and departed from, the system.</li><li>The number of processing objects in process (that is, either waiting in a queue/buffer or being processed)</li><li>The average time a processing object spends in the system (also called <em>throughput time</em>).</li></ol><p>During a simulation run, it must hold that the number of processing objects that arrived at the system is equal to the sum of the number of processing objects in process and the number of processing objects that departed from the system, symbolically: </p><div style="text-align:center;"><i>arrived</i> = <i>in-process</i> + <i>departed</i></div><p> </p><section class="role-section1" id="secPN-CM"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">4.1</span>. </span>Conceptual Modeling of Processing Networks</h2><p>For accommodating PN modeling, OEM-A is extended by adding pre-defined types for processing objects, entry node objects, arrival events, processing node objects, processing activities, exit objects and departure events, resulting in <em>OEM-PN</em>.

PN Node rectangles take the form of stereotyped UML object rectangles, while PN Flow arrows have a special arrow head, as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secPN-DM__figWS3PDM-PN"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-6</span></span></a>. </p><figure id="secPN-DM__figWS3PDM-PN"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-6</span>. </span>A PN model of a workstation system using PN Node rectangles and PN Flow arrows</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="Activities_files/WS3_PDM-PN.svg" width="450" /></div></figure></section><section><h4>PN example 2: a workstation may have to rework parts</h4><p>Parts that turn out to be defective after being processed need to be reworked. This can be modeled by adding an attribute percentDefective to the object type Workstation and suitable logic to the Processing activity end event rule such that in percentDefective % of all cases a processed part cannot depart the system (i.e., is not removed from the input buffer), but is being reworked by another Processing activity.</p><figure id="secPN-DM__figWS4PDM-PN"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-7</span>. </span>A PN model of a workstation system where parts may have to be reworked </figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="Activities_files/WS4_PDM-PN.svg" width="550" /></div></figure></section><section><h4>PN example 3: Department of Motor Vehicles</h4><p>A Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has two consecutive service desks: a reception desk and a case handling desk.

The customer then goes to the waiting area and waits for being called by the case handling desk where her case will be processed. After completing the case handling, the customer leaves the DMV via the exit.</p><p>Customer arrivals are modeled with an «entry node» element (with name “dmvEntry”), the two consecutive service desks are modeled with two «processing node» elements, and the departure of customers is modeled with an «exit node» element (with name “dmvExit”).</p><figure id="secPN-DM__figDmvPDM"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-8</span>. </span>A PN model using the new DPMN modeling elements of PN Node rectangles and PN Flow arrows</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="Activities_files/DMV_PDM.svg" width="600" /></div></figure></section></section><section class="role-section1" id="secProprietaryApproaches"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">4.3</span>. </span>Proprietary terminologies and diagram languages</h2><p>Even after a 50 years history of PN modeling and simulation there is still no vendor-neutral language definition for the PN paradigm, e.g., in the form of a meta-model, which could be used as a basis for comparing and evaluating different PN modeling tools, and for interchanging models between them. The simulation modeling concepts of the PN paradigm, which have been pioneered by GPSS and SIMAN/Arena, have been adopted by many other simulation software products, including Simul8, Simio and AnyLogic. However, each product based on this paradigm uses its own variants of the PN concepts, together with their own proprietary terminology and proprietary diagram language, as illustrated by <a class="role-table-ref" href="#secProprietaryApproaches__tblTerminologyComparison"><span class="role-label">Table <span class="role-number">4-1</span></span></a>.</p><table border="1" id="secProprietaryApproaches__tblTerminologyComparison"><caption><span class="role-label">Table <span class="role-number">4-1</span>. </span>Comparison of different terminologies used for the same PN modeling concepts.</caption><thead><tr><th>OEM</th><th>Arena</th><th>Simul8</th><th>Simio</th><th>AnyLogic</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Processing Object</p></td><td><p>Entity</p></td><td><p>Work Item</p></td><td><p>Token</p></td><td><p>Agent</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Entry Node</p></td><td><p>Create</p></td><td><p>Start Point</p></td><td><p>Source</p></td><td><p>Source</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Processing Node</p></td><td><p>Process </p></td><td><p>Queue+Activity</p></td><td><p>Server</p></td><td><p>Service or Seize+Delay+Release</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Exit Node</p></td><td><p>Dispose</p></td><td><p>End Point</p></td><td><p>Sink</p></td><td><p>Sink</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notice especially the strange term “Agent” used by AnyLogic, instead of the Arena term “Entity”, for processing objects like manufacturing parts in production systems or patients in hospitals.
