For each resource object type, a collection-valued property (such as <em>rooms</em> or <em>doctors</em>) representing a resource pool is added to the object type representing the process owner.</p><section><h4>A simple model with resource counters</h4><p>Using the conceptual information model shown in <a href="secCM.html#figResRoles"></a> as a starting point, we first rename all classes and properties according to OO naming conventions and replace each of the two (conceptual) operations <em>allocate a room</em> and <em>allocate a doctor</em> with a triple of <i>isAvailable</i>/<i>allocate</i>/<i>release</i> operations for the two resource object classes <em>Room</em> and <em>Doctor</em> in the <em>MedicalDepartment</em> class, where we also add the counter attributes <em>nmrOfRooms</em> and <em>nmrOfDoctors</em>. Then, the two resource object classes <em>Room</em> and <em>Doctor</em> are dropped. The result of this elaboration is the information design model shown in <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep1IDM1"></a>.</p><figure id="figMedDep1IDM1"><figcaption>An information model for the simplified design with the resource counters nmrOfRooms and nmrOfDoctors.</figcaption><div><img src="MedExam1_IDM1.svg" /></div></figure><p>Using the conceptual process model shown in <a href="secCM.html#figMedDepCPM1"></a> as a starting point and based on the type definitions of the information design model of <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep1IDM1"></a>, we get the following process design.</p><figure id="figMedDep1PDM1"><figcaption>A process design model based on the information design model of <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep1IDM1"></a>.</figcaption><div><img src="MedDep1_PDM1.png" /></div></figure><p>This process model defines the following two event rules. </p><table border="1"><thead><tr><th>ON pa: PatientArrival</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>md : MedicalDepartment <br />resAllocated : Boolean<br />md := pa.medicalDepartment</td></tr><tr><td>IF md.isRoomAvailable() AND md.isDoctorAvailable()<br />THEN md.allocateRoom(); md.allocateDoctor(); resAllocated := true<br />ELSE md.waitingPatients.push( pa.patient); resAllocated := false</td></tr><tr><td>IF resAllocated SCHEDULE Examination( patient:=pa.patient, medicalDepartment:=md)</td></tr></tbody></table><table border="1"><thead><tr><th>ON ex: Examination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>md : MedicalDepartment <br />anotherPatientFetched : Boolean<br />p: Patient<br />md := ex.medicalDepartment</td></tr><tr><td>IF md.waitingPatients.length = 0<br />THEN md.releaseRoom(); md.releaseDoctor(); anotherPatientFetched := false<br />ELSE p := md.waitingPatients.pop(); anotherPatientFetched := true</td></tr><tr><td>IF anotherPatientFetched SCHEDULE Examination( patient:=p, medicalDepartment:=md)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notice that the event scheduling arrows of <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep1PDM1"></a>, and also the SCHEDULE statements of the corresponding event rule tables, do not contain assignments of the duration of activities, since it is assumed that, by default, whenever an activity type has an operation <em>duration()</em>, the duration of activities of this type are assigned by invoking this operation.</p></section><section><h4>A general model with resource objects as members of resource pools</h4><p>In a more general approach, instead of using resource counter attributes, explicitly modeling resource object classes (like <em>Room</em> and <em>Doctor</em>) allows representing resource roles (stereotyped with «res») and resource pools (stereotyped with «pool») in the form of collections (like <em>md.rooms</em> and <em>md.doctors</em>) and modeling various forms of non-availability of resources (such as machines being defective or humans not being in the shift plan) with the help of corresponding resource status values (such as OUT_OF_ORDER). The result of this elaboration is the information design model shown in <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep1IDM2"></a>.</p><figure id="figMedDep1IDM2"><figcaption>An OEM-A class model with resource object types for modeling resource roles and pools.</figcaption><div><img src="MedExam1_IDM2.svg" /></div></figure><p>For an OEM-A class model, like the one shown in <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep1IDM2"></a>, the following completeness constraint must hold: when an object type <i>O</i> (like <i>Doctor</i>) participates in a «res» association (a resource role association) with an activity type <i>A</i> (like <i>Examination</i>), the process owner object type of <i>A</i> (<i>MedicalDepartment</i>) must have a «pool» association with <i>O</i>.</p><figure id="figMedDep1PDM2"><figcaption>A process design model based on the information design model of <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep1IDM2"></a>.</figcaption><div><img src="MedDep1_PDM2.png" /></div></figure></section><section><h4>Extending OE Class Diagrams by adding a «resource type» category</h4><p>The information design model of <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep1IDM2"></a> contains two object types, <i>Room</i> and <i>Doctor</i>, which are the range of resource role and resource pool properties (association ends stereotyped «res» and «pool»). Such object types can be categorized as «resource type» with the implied meaning that they inherit a resource status attribute from a pre-defined class <code>Resource</code>, as shown in <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep1IDM3"></a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Any resource type <i>R</i> extends the pre-defined object type <code>Resource</code></figcaption><div><img src="Resource-Object.svg" /></div></figure><p>The introduction of resource types to OEM class models allows simplifying models by dropping the following modeling items from OEM-A class models, making them part of the implicit semantics:</p><ol><li>the <i>status</i> attributes of object types representing resource types, which are implicitly inherited;</li><li>the pre-defined enumeration <i>ResourceStatusEL</i>;</li><li>the resource management operations <i>isAvailable</i>, <i>allocate</i> and <i>release</i>, which are implicitly inherited by any resource type; and</li><li>the planned activity queues may possibly be implicitly represented for any resource-constrained activity type in the form of ordered multi-valued reference properties of its process owner object type.</li></ol> This is shown in <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep1IDM3"></a>.<figure id="figMedDep1IDM3"><figcaption>A simplified version of the model of <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep1IDM2"></a> </figcaption><div><img src="MedExam1-DM3.svg" /></div></figure></section><section id="RevisitingManufacturingWS"><h4>Revisiting the manufacturing workstation example</h4><p>A manufacturing workstation, or a &quot;server&quot; in the terminology of Operation Research, represents a resource for the processing activities performed at/by it. This was left implicit in the OEM-A class model shown on the right-hand side of <a href="secDesM.html#figWorkstationIDM"></a>. Using the new modeling elements (resource types, resource roles and resource pools), the processing activities of a workstation can be explicitly modeled as resource-constrained activities, leading to the OEM-A class model shown in <a href="secDesM-2.html#figWS3IDM3"></a> and to a more high-level and more readable process model compared to the process model of <a href="secDesM.html#figWorkstationPDM"></a>. </p><figure id="figWS3IDM3"><figcaption>An OE Class Diagram modeling a single workstation system with resource-constrained processing activities </figcaption><div><img src="WS3_IDM3.svg" /></div></figure></section><section><h4>Decoupling the allocation of multiple resources</h4><p>In a simplified simulation design for the extended scenario (with patients and nurses first walking to examination rooms before doctors are allocated for starting the examinations) described by the conceptual models of <a href="secCM.html#figMedDepCIM4"></a> and <a href="secCM.html#figMedDepCPM4"></a>, we do not consider the walks of doctors, but only the walks of nurses and patients. For simplicity, we drop the superclass <i>people</i> and associate the activity type <i>WalkToRoom</i> with the <i>Patient</i> and Nurse classes. The result of this elaboration is the information design model shown in <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep2IDM2"></a>.</p><figure id="figMedDep2IDM2"><figcaption>An information design model for decoupling the allocation of rooms and doctors.</figcaption><div><img src="MedExam2_IDM2.svg" /></div></figure><figure id="figMedDep2PDM1"><figcaption>A process design model based on the information design model of <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep2IDM2"></a>.</figcaption><div><img src="MedDep2_PDM1.png" /></div></figure><p>This process design model defines three event rules. Notice that the <i>Examination</i> event rule either re-allocates the doctor to the next planned examination and schedules it, if there is one, or it releases the doctor and re-allocates the room to the next planned walk-to-room and schedules it, if there is one.</p><p></p></section><section><h4>Centralizing the re-allocation of resources</h4><p>As shown before, in the conceptual process models of <a href="secCM.html#figMedDepCPM3"></a> and <a href="secCM.html#figMedDepCPM4"></a>, the re-allocation of resources can be centralized with the help of resource release request events and the process owner and the involved performers can be displayed by using a Pool that is partitioned into Lanes for the involved activity performers, resulting in the model shown in <a href="secDesM-2.html#figMedDep4PDM1"></a>.</p><figure id="figMedDep4PDM1"><figcaption>Representing the process owner as a Pool and activity performers as Lanes in a process design model.</figcaption><div><img src="MedDep4_PDM1.png" /></div></figure></section></body></html>
