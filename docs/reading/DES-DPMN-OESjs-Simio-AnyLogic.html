defining computationally complete process design models for event-based simulation, which can be viewed as the most fundamental <i>Discrete Event Simulation (DES)</i> paradigm. In these diagrams, circles represent event types, and arrows between two event type circles <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> represent <i>event scheduling</i> with a <i>future events list</i> in the sense that an occurrence of an event of type <i>A</i> in a simulation run causes the simulator to schedule a future event of type <i>B</i>. </p><section class="role-section1" id="What-is-DES"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.1</span>. </span>What Is Discrete Event Simulation?</h2><p>The term <em>Discrete Event Simulation (DES)</em> has been established as an umbrella term subsuming various kinds of computer simulation approaches, all based on the general idea of modeling entities/objects and events. In the DES literature, it is often stated that DES is based on the concept of <q>entities flowing through the system</q> (more precisely, through a <q>queueing network</q>). This is the paradigm of an entire class of simulation software in the tradition of GPSS (<a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#Gordon61">Gordon, 1961</a>) and SIMAN/Arena (<a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#Peg92">Pegden &amp; Davis, 1992</a>). However, this paradigm characterizes a special (yet important) class of DES only, it does not apply to all discrete event systems.</p><p><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/019.pdf">Pegden (2010)</a> explains that the 50 year history of DES has been shaped by three fundamental paradigms: <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2009/RM3310.pdf">Markowitz, Hausner and Karr (1962)</a> pioneered the <i>event worldview</i> with <i lang="en-GB">SIMSCRIPT</i>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1460764.1460768">Gordon (1961)</a> pioneered the <i>Processing Network worldview</i> with <i>GPSS</i>, and <a href="http://simula67.at.ifi.uio.no/Archive/artikkel1966cacm.pdf">Dahl and Nygaard (1967)</a> pioneered the <i>object worldview</i> with <i>Simula</i>. Notice that we have changed Pegdenâs original name âprocess worldviewâ to âProcessing Network worldviewâ because this paradigm is not based on a general concept of processes, but rather on a special concept of <i>processing processes</i> where entities are subject to processing steps performed at the nodes of a (queueing) network.</p><p>While the concept of an event is often limited to instantaneous events in the area of DES, the general concept of an event, as discussed in philosophy and in many fields of computer science, includes composite events and events with non-zero duration.</p><p>A <em>discrete event system</em> (or <em>discrete dynamic system</em>) consists of</p><ul><li>objects (of various types) having a state (consisting of qualities) and dispositions,</li><li>events (of various types) triggering certain dispositions of objects participating in them,</li></ul><p>such that the states of affected objects may be changed by events according to the dispositions triggered by them. It is natural to consider the concept of <em>discrete events</em>, occurring at times from a discrete set of time points.</p><p>For modeling a discrete event system as a state transition system, we have to describe its</p><ol><li><b> <i>object types</i> </b>, e.g., in the form of <em>classes</em> of an object-oriented language;</li><li><b> <i>event types</i> </b>, e.g., in the form of <em>classes</em> of an object-oriented language;</li><li><b> <i>causal regularities</i> </b> (<em>disposition types</em>) e.g., in the form of <em>event rules</em>.</li></ol><p>Any DES formalism has one or more language elements that allow specifying <em>event rules</em> representing causal regularities. These rules specify, for any event type, the <em>state changes</em> of objects and the <em>follow-up events</em> caused by the occurrence of an event of that type, thus defining the dynamics of the transition system. Unfortunately, this is often obscured by the standard definitions of DES that are repeatedly presented in simulation textbooks and tutorials.</p><p>According to Pegden (<a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#Peg10">2010</a>), a <em>simulation modeling worldview</em> provides <q>a framework for defining a system in sufficient detail that it can be executed to simulate the behavior of the system</q>. It <q>must precisely define the dynamic state transitions that occur over time</q>. Pegden explains that the 50 year history of DES has been shaped by three fundamental paradigms: Markowitz, Hausner, and Karr (<a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#MarkHK62">1962</a>) pioneered the <em>event worldview</em> with <em>SIMSCRIPT</em>, Gordon (<a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#Gordon61">1961</a>) pioneered the <em>processing network worldview</em> with <em>GPSS</em>, and Dahl and Nygaard (<a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#DahlNygaard66">1966</a>) pioneered the <em>object worldview</em> with <em>Simula</em>. Pegden characterizes these paradigms in the following way:</p><p><b><i>Event worldview</i></b>: The system is viewed as a series of instantaneous events that change the state of the system over time. The modeler defines the events in the system and models the state changes that take place when those events occur. According to Pegden, the event worldview is the most fundamental worldview since the other worldviews also use events, at least implicitly.</p><p><b><i>Processing Network worldview</i></b>: The system under investigation is described as a processing network where <q>entities flow through the system</q> (or, more precisely, work objects are routed through the network) and are subject to a series of processing steps performed at processing nodes through processing activities, possibly requiring resources and inducing queues of work objects waiting for the availability of resources (processing networks have been called <q>queueing networks</q> in Operations Research). This approach allows high-level modeling with semi-visual languages and is therefore the most widely used DES approach nowadays, in particular in manufacturing industries and service industries. Simulation platforms based on this worldview may or may not support object-oriented modeling and programming.</p><p><b><i>Object worldview</i></b>: The system is modeled by describing the objects that make up the system. The system behavior emerges from the <q>interaction</q> of these objects.</p><p>All three worldviews lack important conceptual elements. The event worldview does not consider objects with their (categorical and dispositional) properties. The processing network worldview neither considers events nor objects. And the object worldview, while it considers objects with their <em>categorical</em> properties, does not consider events. None of the three worldviews includes modeling the <em>dispositional</em> properties of objects with a full-fledged explicit concept of <em>event rules</em>.</p><p>The event worldview and the object worldview can be combined in approaches that support both objects and events as first-class citizens. This seems highly desirable because (1) objects (and classes) are a must-have in todayâs state-of-the-art modeling and programming, and (2) a general concept of events is fundamental in DES, as demonstrated by the classical event worldview. We use the term <em>object-event worldview</em> for any DES approach combining OO modeling and programming with a general concept of events.</p></section><section class="role-section1" id="secMDE"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.2</span>. </span>Model-Driven Engineering</h2><p><em>Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)</em>, also called <i>model-driven development</i>, is a well-established paradigm in software engineering. Since simulation engineering can be viewed as a special case of software engineering, it is natural to apply the ideas of MDE also to simulation engineering.</p><p>In MDE, there is a distinction between three kinds of models as engineering artifacts created in the analysis, design and implementation phases of a development project:</p><ol><li><i>domain models</i> (also called <i>conceptual models</i>), which describe a real-world domain (and are independent of a computational solution),</li><li><i>design models</i>, which define platform-independent solution designs,</li><li><i>implementation models</i>, which are platform-specific.</li></ol><p>Domain models are solution-independent descriptions of a problem domain produced in the analysis phase. A domain model may include both descriptions of the domain's state structure (in conceptual <i>information models</i>) and descriptions of its processes (in conceptual <i>process models</i>). They are solution-independent, or computation-independent, in the sense that they are not concerned with making any system design choices or with other computational issues. Rather, they focus on the perspective and language of the subject matter experts for the domain under consideration.</p><p>In the design phase, first a platform-independent design model, as a general computational solution, is developed on the basis of the domain model. The same domain model can potentially be used to produce a number of (even radically) different design models. Then, by taking into consideration a number of implementation issues ranging from architectural styles, nonfunctional quality criteria to be maximized (e.g., performance, adaptability) and target technology platforms, one or more platform-specific implementation models are derived from the design model. These one-to-many relationships between conceptual models, design models and implementation models are illustrated in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secMDE__figMDD"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-1</span></span></a>.</p><figure id="secMDE__figMDD"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-1</span>. </span>From conceptualization via design to implementation</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/MDD.svg" width="500" /></div></figure><p>In general, a model does not consist of just one model diagram including all viewpoints or aspects of the system to be developed. Rather it consists of a set of models, one (or more) for each viewpoint. The two most important viewpoints, crosscutting all three modeling levels (domain conceptualization, design and implementation) are</p><ol><li><b><i>information modeling</i></b>, which is concerned with the <b><i>state structure</i> </b>of the domain, design or implementation;</li><li><b><i>process modeling</i></b>, which is concerned with the <b><i>dynamics</i> </b>of the domain, design or implementation.</li></ol><p>Examples of widely used languages for information modeling are <em>Entity Relationship (ER) Diagrams</em> and <em>UML Class Diagrams</em>. Since the latter subsume the former, we prefer using UML class diagrams for making all kinds of information models, including SQL database models.</p><p>Examples of widely used languages for process modeling are <em>(Colored) Petri Nets</em>, <em>UML Sequence Diagrams,</em> <em>UML Activity Diagrams</em> and the <em>BPMN</em>. Notice that there is more agreement on the right concepts for information modeling than for process modeling, as indicated by the much larger number of different process modeling languages. This reflects a lower degree of understanding the nature of events and processes compared to understanding objects and their relationships.</p><p>Model-driven simulation engineering is based on the same kinds of models as model-driven software engineering: going from a <em>domain model</em> via a<em>design model</em> to an <em>implementation model</em> for the simulation platform of choice (or to several implementation models if there are several target simulation platforms). The specific concerns of simulation engineering, like, e.g., the concern to capture certain parts of the overall system dynamics with the help of random variables, do not affect the applicability of MDE principles. However, they define requirements for the modeling languages to be used.</p></section><section class="role-section1" id="secUML"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.3</span>. </span>Information Modeling with UML Class Diagrams</h2><p>Conceptual information modeling is mainly concerned with describing the relevant <b><i>entity types</i></b> of a real-world domain and the relationships between them, while information design and implementation modeling are concerned with describing the <i>logical</i> (or <i>platform-independent</i>) and <i>platform-specific</i> data structures (in the form of <b><i>classes</i></b>) for designing and implementing a software system or simulation. The most important kinds of relationships between entity types to be described in an information model are <b><i>associations</i></b> and <b><i>subtype</i></b>/<i>supertype</i> relationships, which are called âgeneralizationsâ in <i>UML</i>.</p><p>In UML Class Diagrams, an entity type is described with a name, and possibly with a list of <b><i>properties</i></b> and <b><i>operations</i></b> (called <i>methods</i> when implemented), in the form of a <i>class rectangle</i> with one, two or three compartments, depending on the presence of properties and operations. <b><i>Integrity constraints</i></b>, which are conditions that must be satisfied by the instances of a type, can be expressed in special ways when defining properties or they can be explicitly attached to an entity type in the form of an <i>invariant</i> box.</p><p>An <b><i>association</i></b> between two entity types is expressed as a connection line between the two class rectangles representing the entity types. The connection line is annotated with <i>multiplicity</i> expressions at both ends. A <b><i>multiplicity</i></b> expression has the form <code>m..n</code> where <i>m</i> is a non-negative natural number denoting the <i>minimum cardinality</i>, and <i>n</i> is a positive natural number (or the special symbol * standing for <i>unbounded)</i> denoting the maximum cardinality, of the sets of associated entities. Typically, a multiplicity expression states an integrity constraint. For instance, the multiplicity expression <code>1..3</code> means that there are at least 1 and at most 3 associated entities. However, the special multiplicity expression <code>0..*</code> (also expressed as <code>*</code>) means that there is no constraint since the minimum cardinality is zero and the maximum cardinality is unbounded.</p><p>For instance, the model shown in <a href="#secUML__figShopDelivery">Figure 3</a> describes the entity types <code>Shop</code> and <code>Delivery</code>, and it states that</p><ol><li>there are two classes: <code>Shop</code> and <code>Delivery</code>, representing entity types;</li><li>there is a one-to-many association between the classes <code>Shop</code> and <code>Delivery</code>, where a shop is the <code>receiver</code> of a delivery.</li></ol><figure id="secUML__figShopDelivery"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-2</span>. </span>The entity types Shop and Delivery.</figcaption><img src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/IntroUML1.svg" width="400" /></figure><p>Using further compartments in class rectangles, we can add properties and operations. For instance, in the model shown in <a href="#secUML__figShopDelivery2">Figure 4</a>, we have added</p><ol><li>the properties <em>name</em> and <em>stockQuantity</em> to <code>Shop</code> and <em>quantity</em> to <code>Delivery</code>,</li><li>the instance-level operation <em>onEvent</em> to <code>Delivery</code>,</li><li>the class-level operation <em>leadTime</em> to <code>Delivery</code>.</li></ol><figure id="secUML__figShopDelivery2"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-3</span>. </span>Adding properties and operations.</figcaption><img src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/IntroUML2.svg" width="450" /></figure><p>Notice that in <a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#_Ref493071591">Figure 4</a>, each property is declared together with a datatype as its <em>range</em>. Likewise, operations are declared with a (possibly empty) list of parameters, and with an optional return value type. When an operation (or property) declaration is underlined, this means that it is class-level instead of instance-level. For instance, the underlined operation declaration <u><code>leadTime(): Decimal</code></u> indicates that <em>leadTime</em> is a class-level operation that does not take any argument and returns a decimal number.</p><p>We may want to define various types of integrity constraints for better capturing the semantics of entity types, properties and operations. The model shown in <a href="#secUML__figShopDelivery3">Figure 5</a> contains an example of a property constraint and an example of an operation constraint. These types of constraints can be expressed within curly braces appended to a property or operation declaration. The keyword <code>id</code> in the declaration of the property <code>name</code> in the <code>Shop</code> class expresses an ID constraint stating that the property is a standard identifier, or primary key, attribute. The expression <code>Exp(0.5)</code> in the declaration of the random variable operation <code>leadTime</code> in the <code>Delivery</code> class denotes the constraint that the operation must implement the <em>exponential</em> probability distribution function with event rate 0.5.</p><figure id="secUML__figShopDelivery3"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-4</span>. </span>Adding a property constraint and an operation constraint.</figcaption><img src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/IntroUML3.svg" width="500" /></figure><p>UML allows defining special categories of modeling elements called <q>stereotypes</q>. For instance, for distinguishing between <b><i>object types</i></b> and <b><i>event types</i></b> as two different categories of entity types we can define corresponding stereotypes of UML classes (Â«object typeÂ» and Â«event typeÂ») and use them for categorizing classes in class models, as shown in <a href="#secUML__figShopDelivery4">Figure 6</a>.</p><figure id="secUML__figShopDelivery4"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-5</span>. </span>Object and event types as two different categories of entity types.</figcaption><img src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/IntroUML4.svg" width="500" /></figure><p>Another example of using UMLâs stereotype feature is the designation of an operation as a function that represents a <em>random variable</em> using the operation stereotype Â«rvÂ» in the diagram of <a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#_Ref493015782">Figure 6</a>.</p><p>A class may be defined as <em>abstract</em> by writing its name in italics, as in the example model of <a href="file:/D:/Repos/JSimE-Articles/1/1/index.html#_Ref493094582">Figure 11</a>.

However, BPMN does not allow restricting such a timeout mechanism to the waiting phase of a task (planned activity), that is the time span during which the task has been enqueued, but not yet started. Rather, it applies to the entire cycle time of <em>take order</em> activities, which means that also started activities, where the order taker is already listening to the customer, may be canceled due to reneging.</p><p>While BPMN allows modeling the performers of activities with swimlanes (referring to organizational positions with corresponding resource pools), it does not support modeling other types of resource objects, such as machines or rooms. As a workaround, the model above includes two BPMN <em>Data Objects</em>, <em>ovens</em> and <em>scooters</em>, for representing resource objects. Also, BPMN does not allow specifying resource cardinality constraints (e.g., for stating that making a pizza requires two pizza makers and one oven).</p><p>The third, and most severe, issue of the BPMN model is its uniform (semantically overloaded) use of &quot;sequence flow&quot; arrows for sequencing both events and activities. While in the case of all three activities, incoming &quot;sequence flow&quot; arrows do not mean that an activity is started, but rather that a new task is enqueued (and only started when all required resources become available), in the case of the <em>lost order</em> event, the incoming &quot;sequence flow&quot; arrow means that a new event is scheduled to occur immediately.</p><p>BPMN has the following issues:</p><ol><li>A <strong>limited</strong> concept of &quot;business processes&quot; as isolated &quot;cases&quot;, which does not allow to account for any dependency between business processes (e.g., competing for resources).</li><li>Overloading/<strong>ambiguity</strong> of <em>sequence flow arrows</em>, which represent various kinds of connections, including resource-independent event flows and resource-dependent activity scheduling.</li><li><strong>Insufficient</strong> integration of the <i><strong>objects</strong></i> that participate in a process.</li><li><strong>Insufficient</strong> support of <i><strong>resource management</strong></i>. In particular, no other resources except (human) performers can be modeled, and the important concepts of resource cardinality constraints, resource pools, alternative resource types and resource allocation priorities are not supported.</li><li><strong>No</strong> support of <i><strong>processing activities</strong></i> and <em>processing networks</em>, which are generalized queueing networks where processing objects enter a system via arrival events and then &quot;flow through the system&quot;.</li><li><strong>No</strong> convincing <i><strong>formal semantics</strong></i>. BPMN's execution semantics is defined in terms of an abstract Petri-Net-style &quot;token&quot; flow (following the predominant academic paradigm), which does not match its intuitive semantics based on event flows and resource-dependent activity scheduling.</li></ol><h4>DPMN solves the issues of BPMN</h4>The <em>Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation (DPMN)</em> is a Discrete Event Simulation modeling language based on <em>Event Graphs</em> (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358460">Schruben 1983</a>) and BPMN.

The relevant <i>object types</i> and <i>event types</i> are described in an information model, which is the basis for making a process model. A modeling approach that follows the OEM paradigm is called an <i>OEM approach</i>. Such an approach needs to choose, or define, an information modeling language (such as <em>Entity Relationship Diagrams</em> or <em>UML Class Diagrams</em>) and a process modeling language (such as <em>UML Activity Diagrams</em> or <em>BPMN Process Diagrams</em>).</p><p>We propose an OEM approach based on <em>UML Class Diagrams</em> for conceptual information modeling and information design modeling, as well as <em>DPMN Process Diagrams</em> for conceptual process modeling and for process design modeling. </p><p>In the proposed approach, object types and event types are modeled as special categories of classes in a UML Class Diagram. <i>Random variables</i> are modeled as a special category of class-level operations constrained to comply with a specific probability distribution such that they can be implemented as static methods of a class. <i>Queues</i> are not modeled as objects, but rather as ordered association ends, which can be implemented as collection-valued reference properties. Finally, <i>event rules</i>, which include <i>event routines</i>, are modeled in DPMN process diagrams (and possibly also in pseudo-code), such that they can be implemented in the form of special <i>onEvent</i> methods of event classes.</p><p>Like Petri Nets and DEVS, OEM&amp;S has a formal semantics. But while Petri Nets and DEVS are abstract computational formalisms without an ontological foundation, OEM&amp;S is based on the ontological categories of objects, events and causal regularities.</p><p>In model-based simulation engineering, we distinguish between (1) a <em>conceptual model</em> describing a real-world problem domain, and (2) a <em>simulation design model</em> defining a certain computational solution for the purpose of a simulation study. Both conceptual models and design models consist of an <em>OE class model</em> describing/defining the system's <em>state structure</em> (in the form of <em>object types</em> and <em>event types</em>, and the <em>associations</em> between them) and a <em>DPMN process model</em> describing/defining the system's <em>dynamics</em> (in the form of <em>causal regularities</em> captured by <em>event rules</em>).</p><p>An OEM approach results in a simulation design model that has a well-defined operational semantics in terms of a transition system based on the event rules modeled in a DPMN process design diagram, as shown by Wagner (<a href="https://www.informs-sim.org/wsc17papers/includes/files/056.pdf">2017a</a>). Such a model can, in principle, be implemented with any object-oriented (OO) simulation technology.

In the case of an activity node, these participating objects include the <strong>resource objects</strong> required for performing an activity.

This is now expressed implicitly by the semantics of the resource-dependent activity scheduling (RDAS) arrow and has to be handled in a generic way by a simulator supporting DPMN-A models.</p><p>The following diagram shows a model containing both event scheduling arrows and RDAS arrows:</p><figure id="secProcesses__lof__12"><div><img src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/PDM.svg" width="700" /></div><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-12</span>. </span>A DPMN-A process model of a Load-Haul-Dump business process</figcaption></figure><p>In this model, activities are initiated (1) by an RDAS arrow when they may have to wait for the availability of required resources, or (2) by an event scheduling arrow when no other resources are required. For instance, a new <i>Load</i> activity can only be started, when a wheel loader (as a performer) is available, while a <i>Haul</i> activity can be started immediately after the completion of a <i>Load</i> activity because it's performed by the loaded truck, and no other resources are required.</p><p>The most widely used language for defining ANs is the <em>Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)</em>. However, in BPMN there is only one type of arrow, called &quot;Sequence Flow&quot;, which is semantically overloaded with both meanings: it can represent an event flow arrow or a resource-dependent activity start arrow.</p><p>The concept of ANs includes business system processes, where many business actors perform activities for handling many business cases in parallel. Consequently, it is more general than the common concept of a business process as a case-handling process.</p><p>Normally all activity nodes of an AN have a queue of planned activities (&quot;tasks&quot;) waiting for the availability of required resources (in particular, their performer). Only if a successor activity node does not require additional or different resources, it does not have a (resource allocation) queue and can be started right away whenever a predecessor activity has completed, as indicated by an event flow arrow. </p><p>When all activity nodes of an AN only have a single resource (the performer of the activity), and each of them has a different performer, then the AN corresponds to a <em>Queuing Network</em> in the sense of Operations Research. </p></section><section><h4>C.

The ES paradigm has been pioneered by <em>SIMSCRIPT</em> (<a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2009/RM3310.pdf">Markowitz, Hausner &amp; Karr 1962</a>) and later formalized by <em>Event Graphs</em> (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358460">Schruben 1983</a>).</p><p>According to Pegden, in ES, the system under investigation is viewed as a series of instantaneous events that change its state over time. The modeler âdefines the events in the system and models the state changes that take place when those events occurâ. More precisely, the modeler defines the <i>types</i> of events that cause <i>state changes</i> and/or <i>follow-up events</i>.</p><p>Pegden also explains that in ES,</p><ol><li>a simulation creates events that are supposed to occur in the future (called <i>future events</i>),</li><li>future events are scheduled (using an <i>event scheduling</i> mechanism),</li><li>time advances to the time of the next event (<i>next-event time progression</i>),</li><li>the series of events corresponds to a sequence of state transitions of a <i>transition system</i> where the âtransition logicâ of each event type is specified in the form of a procedure definition (often called <i>event routine</i>).</li></ol><p>Event routines can be expressed at an abstract level, e.g., using pseudo code as in (<a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/019.pdf">Pegden 2010</a>), or in a simulation or programming language. In an object-oriented approach, it is natural to define an event routine as a method of the class defining the event type.</p><p>Pegden does not make any attempt to clarify the philosophical nature of (types of) events and their âtransition logicâ. Philosophically, (1) all events have <i>participants</i>, which are the objects that participate in them; (2) the combination of an <em>event type</em> and its <i>event routine</i> amounts to an <b><i>event rule</i></b> of the form </p><p class="indented"><b>ON</b> <i>event</i> <b>DO</b> <i>procedure</i></p><p>Basic Object Event Simulation (OES) extends ES, or Event Graphs, by adding the modeling concepts of <em>objects</em> and <em>event rules</em>.</p><section class="role-section1" id="ES-without-Objects"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.1</span>. </span>Event-Based Simulation without Objects</h2><p>When Event-Based Simulation (ES) was developed in the 1960's, pioneered by <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2009/RM3310.pdf">SIMSCRIPT</a>, the software engineering paradigm of Object-Oriented (OO) modeling and OO programming was not yet available. Therefore, the objects of a system have not been modeled as objects, but rather the relevant characteristics of the (objects of) the system under investigation have been modeled in the form of <em>state variables</em>.</p><section><h4>The ES Formalism</h4><p>We illustrate the formal semantics of ES with the help of an example. We model a system of one or more service desks, each of them having its own queue, as a discrete event system characterized by the following narrative:</p><ol><li>Customers arrive at a service desk at random times.</li><li>If there is no other customer in front of them, and the service desk is available, they are served immediately, otherwise they have to queue up in a waiting line.</li><li>The duration of services varies, depending on the individual case.</li><li>When a service is completed, the customer departs and the next customer is served, if there is still any customer in the queue.</li></ol><p>The base concepts of ES are:</p><ol><li><em>state variables</em> for defining the state of a system,</li><li>event types,</li><li>event expressions,</li><li>event routines,</li><li>future events lists (FEL).</li></ol><p>A <b><i>state variable</i></b> is declared with a name and a <em>range</em>, which is a datatype defining its possible values.</p><p>An <b><i>event type</i></b> is defined in the form of a class: with a name, a set of property declarations and a set of method definitions, which together define the <i>signature</i> of the event type.</p><p>An <b><i>event expression</i></b> is a term E<i>(<u>x</u>)@t</i> where</p><ol><li>E is an event type,</li><li><i>t</i> is a parameter for the occurrence time of events,</li><li><i><u>x</u></i> is a (possibly empty) list of event parameters <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, â¦, <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> according to the signature of the event type E.</li></ol><p>For instance, Arrival@<i>t</i> is an event expression for describing Arrival events where the signature of the event type Arrival is empty, so there are no event parameters, and the parameter <i>t</i> denotes the arrival time (more precisely, the occurrence time of the Arrival event). An individual event of type E is a <i>ground</i> event expression, <i>e</i> = E(<i><u>v</u></i>)@<i>i</i>, where the event parameter list <i><u>x</u></i> and the occurrence time parameter <i>t</i> have been instantiated with a corresponding value list <i><u>v</u></i> and a specific time instant <i>i</i>. For instance, Arrival@1 is a ground event expression representing an individual Arrival event.</p>An <b><i>event routine</i></b> is a procedure that essentially computes state changes and follow-up events, possibly based on conditions on the current state. In practice, state changes are often directly performed by immediately updating the state variables concerned, and follow-up events are immediately scheduled by adding them to the FEL. For defining the formal semantics of ES, we assume that an event routine is a pure function that computes state changes and follow-up events, but does not apply them, as in the rules described in <a class="role-table-ref" href="#ES-without-Objects__tblEventRulesArrDep"><span class="role-label">Table <span class="role-number">2-1</span></span></a>.<table border="1" id="ES-without-Objects__tblEventRulesArrDep" style="border-spacing:0px;width:100%;"><caption><span class="role-label">Table <span class="role-number">2-1</span>. </span>Expressing event routines as pure functions that compute state changes and follow-up events.</caption><colgroup style="text-align:center;"></colgroup><colgroup></colgroup><colgroup></colgroup><thead><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"><p><b>Event rule name</b></p></td><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>ON (event expression)</b></p></td><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>DO (event routine)</b></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>r<i><sub>Arr</sub></i></p></td><td><p>Arrival @ t</p></td><td><p>Eâ := { Arrival @ (t + recurrence()) }<br />Î := { INCREMENT queueLength }<br />IF queueLength = 0<br />THEN Eâ := Eâ â { Departure @ (t + serviceDuration()) }<br />RETURN â¨ Î, <i>E'</i> â©</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>r<i><sub>Dep</sub></i></p></td><td><p>Departure @ t</p></td><td><p>Eâ := {}<br />Î := { DECREMENT queueLength }<br />IF queueLength &gt; 1<br />THEN Eâ := Eâ â { Departure @ (t + serviceDuration()) }<br />RETURN â¨ Î, <i>E'</i> â© </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>An <b><i>event rule</i></b> associates an event expression with an <i>event routine F</i>:</p><p class="indented"><b>ON</b> E<i>(<u>x</u>)@t</i> <b>DO</b> <i>F( t, <u>x</u>)</i>,</p><p>where the event expression E<i>(<u>x</u>)@t</i> specifies the type E of events that trigger the rule, and <i>F( t, <u>x</u>)</i> is a function call expression for computing a set of <i>state changes</i> and a set of <i>follow-up events</i>, based on the event parameter values <i><u>x</u></i>, the event's occurrence time <i>t</i> and the current system state, which is accessed in the event routine <i>F</i> for testing conditions expressed in terms of state variables.</p><p>A <b><i>Future Events List (FEL)</i></b> is a set of ground event expressions partially ordered by their occurrence times, which represent future time instants either from a discrete or a continuous model of time. The partial order implies the possibility of simultaneous events, as in the example { Departure@4, Arrival@4 }.</p><section><h5>ES Models</h5><p>An <em>ES<b><i> </i></b>model</em> is a triple â¨ SV, ET, R â© where</p><ol><li>SV is a set of state variable declarations defining the structure of possible system states,</li><li>ET is a set of event type definitions,</li><li>R is a set of event rules expressed in terms of SV and ET.</li></ol><p>We show how to express the example model of a simple service desk system as an ES model. The set of state variables is a singleton:</p><p class="indented">SV = { queueLength: NonNegativeInteger}</p><p>There are two event types, both having an empty signature:</p><p class="indented">ET = { Arrival(), Departure()}</p><p>And there are two event rules:</p><p class="indented">R = { r<i><sub>Arr</sub></i>, r<i><sub>Dep</sub></i>}</p><p>which are defined as in Table 1 above.</p><p>Such a model, together with an initial state (specifying initial values for state variables and initial events), defines an ES system, which is a transition system where</p><ol><li>system states are defined by value assignments for the state variables,</li><li>transitions are provided by event occurrences triggering event rules that change the simulation state through changing the system state (by changing the values of affected state variables) and the FEL (by adding follow-up events).</li></ol><p>Whenever the transitions of an ES system involve computations based on random numbers (if the simulation model contains random variables), the transition system defined is non-deterministic.</p><p>For instance, assuming that the initial system state is <i>S</i><sub>0</sub> = {queueLength: 0}, and there is an initial event {Arrival@1}, then, as a consequence of applying r<i><sub>Arr</sub></i>, there is a system state change {queueLength := 1} and, assuming a random service time of 2 time units (as a sample from the underlying probability distribution function), a follow-up event Departure@3, which has to be scheduled along with the next Arrival event, say Arrival@3 (with a random inter-arrival time of 2), because Arrival is an exogenous event type (with a random recurrence). Consequently, the next system state is <i>S</i><sub>1</sub> = {queueLength: 1}.</p><p>We need to distinguish between the <i>system state</i>, like <i>S</i><sub>0</sub> = {queueLength: 0}, which is the state of the simulated system, and the <i>simulation state</i>, which adds the FEL to the system state, like</p><p class="indented"><b><i>S</i></b><sub>0</sub> = â¨ {queueLength: 0}, {Arrival@1} â©</p><p class="indented"><b><i>S</i></b><sub>1</sub> = â¨ {queueLength: 1}, {Arrival@2, Departure@3} â©</p><p>Doing one more step, the next transition is given by the next event Arrival@2 again triggering r<i><sub>Arr</sub></i>, which leads to</p><p class="indented"><b><i>S</i></b><sub>2</sub> = â¨ {queueLength: 2}, {Departure@3, Arrival@4} â©</p><p>In this way, we get a succession of states <b><i>S</i></b><sub>0</sub> <span style="font-family:monospace;">â</span> <b><i>S</i></b><sub>1</sub> <span style="font-family:monospace;">â</span> <b><i>S</i></b><sub>2</sub> <span style="font-family:monospace;">â</span> â¦ as a history of the transition system defined by the ES model.</p></section><section><h5>Event Rules as Functions</h5><p>An event rule <i>r</i> = <b>ON</b> E<i>(<u>x</u>)@t</i> <b>DO</b> <i>F( t, <u>x</u>)</i> can be considered as a 2-step function that, in the first step, maps an event <i>e</i> = E(<i><u>v</u></i>)@<i>i</i> to a parameter-free state change function <i>r<sub>e</sub></i> = <i>F( i, <u>v</u>)</i>, which maps a system state to a pair â¨ Î, <i>E'</i> â© of system state changes Î and follow-up events <i>E'</i>. When the parameters <i>t</i> and<i> <u>x</u></i> of <i>F( t, <u>x</u>)</i> are replaced by the values <i>i</i> and <i><u>v</u></i> provided by a ground event expression E(<i><u>v</u></i>)@<i>i</i>, we also simply write <i>F<sub>i,<u>v</u></sub></i> instead of <i>F( i, <u>v</u>)</i> for the resulting parameter-free state change function.</p><p>We say that an event rule <i>r</i> is <i>triggered</i> by an event <i>e</i> when the eventâs type is the same as the ruleâs triggering event type. When <i>r</i> is triggered by <i>e</i>, we can form the state change function <i>r<sub>e</sub></i> = <i>F<sub>i,<u>v</u></sub></i> and apply it to a system state <i>S</i> by mapping it to a set of system state changes Î and a set of follow-up events <i>E'</i>:</p><p class="indented"><i>r<sub>e</sub>(S)</i> = <i>F<sub>i,<u>v</u></sub>(S)</i> = â¨ Î, <i>E'</i> â©</p><p>We can illustrate this with the help of our running example. Consider the rule r<i><sub>Arr</sub></i> defined in Table 1 above triggered by the event Arrival@1 in state <i>S</i><sub>0</sub> = {queueLength: 0}. The resulting state change function <i>F</i><sub>1</sub> defined by the corresponding event routine from Table 1 maps <i>S</i><sub>0</sub> to the set of state changes Î = { INCREMENT queueLength} and the set of follow-up events <i>E'</i> = {Departure@3}. We show how the pair â¨ Î, <i>E'</i> â© amounts to a transition of the simulation state in the next section.</p><p>In ES, a system state change is an update of one or more state variables. Such an update is specified in the form of an assignment where the right-hand side is an expression that may involve state variables. For instance, the state change <span style="font-family:monospace;">INCREMENT queueLength</span> is equivalent to the assignment <span style="font-family:monospace;">queueLength </span>:=<span style="font-family:monospace;"> queueLength + 1</span>.</p><p>In general, there may be situations, where we have several concurrent events, that is, there may be two or more events occurring at the same (next-event) time. Therefore, we need to explain how to apply a set of rules <i>R<sub>E</sub></i> triggered by a set of events <i>E</i>, even if both sets are singletons in many cases.</p><p>The rule set <i>R</i> of an ES model can also be considered as a 2-step function that, in the first step, maps a set of events <i>E</i> to a state change function <i>R<sub>E</sub></i>, which maps a system state to a pair â¨ Î, <i>E'</i> â© of state changes Î and follow-up events <i>E'</i>.</p><p>For a given set of events <i>E</i> and a rule set <i>R</i>, we can form the set of state change functions obtained from rules triggered by events from <i>E</i>:</p><p class="indented"><i>R<sub>E</sub></i> = { <i>r<sub>e</sub></i> : <i>r</i> â <i>R</i> &amp; <i>e</i> â <i>E</i> &amp; <i>e</i> triggers <i>r</i>}</p><p>Notice that the elements <i>C</i> of <i>R<sub>E</sub></i> are parameter-free state change functions, which can be applied as a block, in parallel, to a system state <i>S:</i></p><p class="indented"><i>R<sub>E</sub>(S)</i> = â¨ Î, <i>E'</i> â©</p><p>with</p><p class="indented">Î = â { Î<i><sub>C</sub></i> : <i>C</i> â <i>R<sub>E</sub></i> &amp; <i>C(S)</i> = â¨ Î<i><sub>C</sub></i>, <i>E'<sub>C</sub></i> â© }<br /><i>E'</i> = â { <i>E'<sub>C</sub></i> : <i>C</i> â <i>R<sub>E</sub></i> &amp; <i>C(S)</i> = â¨ Î<i><sub>C</sub></i>, <i>E'<sub>C</sub></i> â© }</p><p>Notice that when forming the union of all state changes brought about by applying rules from <i>R<sub>E</sub></i>, and likewise when forming the union of all follow-up events created by applying rules from <i>R<sub>E</sub></i>, the order of rule applications does not matter because they do not affect the applicability of each other, so any selection function for choosing rules from <i>R<sub>E</sub></i> and applying them sequentially will do, and they could also be applied simultaneously if such a parallel computation is supported.</p><p>However, computing a set of state changes Î raises the question if this set is, in some sense, consistent. A simple, but too restrictive, notion of consistent state changes would require that if Î contains two or more updates of the same state variable, all of them must be equivalent (effectively assigning the same value). A more liberal notion just requires that if Î contains two or more updates of the same state variable, their collective application must result in the same value for it, no matter in which order they are applied.</p><p>If Î contains inconsistent updates for a state variable, this may be a bug or a feature of the simulation model. If it is not a bug, a conflict resolution policy is needed. The simplest policy is ignoring, or discarding, all inconsistent updates. Another common conflict resolution policy is based on assigning priorities to event rules.</p><p>Consider again our running example with a system state <i>S</i> = {queueLength: 1} and the set of next events <i>N</i> = {Arrival@4, Departure@4}. Then, R<i><sub>N</sub></i> consists of the two parameter-free change functions:</p><ol><li>F<sub>1</sub>: function () {Î := { INCREMENT queueLength}; IF queueLength = 0 THEN <br /> <i>E'</i> := {Â Departure @ (4 + serviceDuration())}; RETURN â¨ Î, <i>E'</i> â© }</li><li>F<sub>2</sub>: function () {Î := { DECREMENT queueLength}; IF queueLength &gt; 1 THEN <br /><i> E'</i> := {Â Departure @ (4 + serviceDuration())}; RETURN â¨ Î, <i>E'</i> â©}</li></ol><p>No matter in which order we apply F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub>, forming the union of their state changes always results in Î = {}, because the incrementation and decrementation of the variable <i>queueLength</i> neutralize each other, and forming the union of their follow-up events always results in <i>E'</i> = { Departure@(4+d)} where d is the random value returned by the <i>serviceDuration</i> function.</p></section><section><h5>An Event Rule Set as a Simulation State Transition Function</h5><p>We show that the event rule set R of an ES model â¨ SV, ET, R â© defines a transition function that maps a simulation state â¨ <i>S</i>, <i>FEL</i> â© to a successor state â¨ <i>S'</i>, <i>FEL'</i> â© in 3 steps:</p><ol><li>R maps the set of next events <i>N</i> extracted from the <i>FEL</i> to a set R<i><sub>N</sub></i> of state change functions of rules triggered by one of the next events from <i>N</i>.</li><li>R<i><sub>N</sub></i> maps the current system state <i>S</i> to a set of state changes Î and a set of follow-up events <i>E'</i>.</li><li>The pair â¨ Î, <i>E'</i> â© amounts to a transition of the current simulation state â¨ <i>S</i>, <i>FEL</i> â© by applying the updates from Î to <i>S</i> yielding <i>Sâ</i> and by removing <i>N</i> from <i>FEL</i> and adding <i>E'</i>.</li></ol><p>We have already explained how to obtain R<i><sub>N</sub></i> from R and how to apply R<i><sub>N</sub></i> to <i>S</i> for getting â¨ Î, <i>E'</i> â© in the previous subsection, so we only need to provide more explanation for the last step: processing â¨ Î, <i>E'</i> â© for obtaining the next simulation state â¨ <i>S'</i>, <i>FEL'</i> â©.</p><p>We use the symbol Upd for denoting an update operation that takes a system state <i>S</i> and a set of state changes Î, and returns an updated system state Upd( <i>S, </i>Î). When the system state consists of state variables, the update operation simply performs assignments. Using this operation, we can define the third step of the simulation state transition function with two sub-steps in the following way:</p><ol type="a"><li><i>S'</i> = Upd( <i>S, </i>Î)</li><li><i>FEL' = FEL <span style="font-family:monospace;">â</span> N </i>â <i>E'</i></li></ol><p>This completes our definition of how the event rule set R of an ES model works as a transition function that computes the successor state of a simulation state:</p><p class="indented">R(â¨ <i>S</i>, <i>FEL </i>â©) = â¨ <i>S'</i>, <i>FEL'</i> â©</p><p>such that for a given initial simulation state <b><i>S</i></b><sub>0</sub> = â¨ <i>S</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>FEL</i><sub>0</sub><i> </i>â©, we obtain a succession of states</p><p class="indented"><b><i>S</i></b><sub>0</sub> <span style="font-family:monospace;">â</span> <b><i>S</i></b><sub>1</sub> <span style="font-family:monospace;">â</span> <b><i>S</i></b><sub>2</sub> <span style="font-family:monospace;">â</span> â¦</p><p>by iteratively applying R:</p><p class="indented"><b><i>S</i></b><sub>i+1</sub> = R( <b><i>S</i></b><sub>i</sub>)</p><p>Consider again our running example.

While in a conceptual model, describing a real-world system, a performer is required for any activity, a simulation design model may abstract away from the performer of an activity.</p><p>For instance, a consultation activity may require a consultant and a room. Such <em>resource cardinality constraints</em> are defined at the type level. When defining the activity type <code>Consultation</code>, these resource cardinality constraints are defined in the form of two mandatory associations with the object types <code>Consultant</code> and <code>Room</code> such that both associations' ends have the multiplicity 1 (&quot;exactly one&quot;). Then, in a simulation run, a new <code>Consultation</code> activity can only be started, when both a <code>Consultant</code> object and a <code>Room</code> object are available.</p><p>For all types of resource-constrained activities, a simulator can automatically collect the following statistics:</p><ol><li><i>Throughput</i> statistics: the numbers of enqueued and dequeued planned activities, and the numbers of started and completed activities.</li><li><i>Queue length</i> statistics (average, maximum, etc.) of its queue of planned activities.</li><li><i>Cycle time</i> statistics (average, maximum, etc.), where cycle time is the sum of the waiting time and the activity duration.</li><li><i>Resource utilization</i> statistics: the percentage of time each resource object involved is busy with an activity of that type.</li></ol><p>In addition, a simulator can automatically collect the percentage of time each resource object involved is idle or out-of-order.</p><figure id="index-4__figActRes"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-6</span>. </span>The resources required for performing an activity include the activity's performer.</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/ResourceConstrained-Activities.svg" /></div></figure><p>For modeling resource-constrained activities, we need to define their types.

The concept of resource-constrained activities is at the center of both DES and BPM. But both fields have developed different, and even incompatible, concepts of business process simulation.<p>In the DES paradigm of Processing Networks, Gordon (1961) has introduced the resource management operations <em>Seize</em> and <em>Release</em> in the simulation language GPSS for allocating and de-allocating (releasing) resources. Thus, GPSS has established a standard modeling pattern for resource-constrained activities, which has become popular under the name of <em>Seize</em>-<em>Delay</em>-<em>Release</em> indicating that for simulating a resource-constrained activity, its resources are first allocated, and then, after some delay (representing the duration of the simulated activity), they are de-allocated (released).</p><section id="secCM-2__secResPools"><h4>Resource roles, process owners and resource pools</h4><p>As an illustrative example, we consider a hospital consisting of medical departments where patients arrive for getting a medical examination performed by a doctor. A medical examination, as an activity, has three participants: a patient, a medical department, and a doctor, but only one of them plays a resource role: doctors. This can be indicated in an OE Class Diagram by using the stereotype Â«resource roleÂ» for categorizing the association ends that represent resource roles, as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figResRoles"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-8</span></span></a>.</p><figure id="secCM-2__figResRoles"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-8</span>. </span>A conceptual information model of the activity type &quot;examinations&quot; with resource roles.</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/MedDep_CIM1.svg" width="500" /></div></figure><p>Notice that both the event type <em>patient arrivals</em> and the activity type <em>examinations</em> have a (mandatory functional) reference property <em>process owner</em>. This implies that both patient arrival events and examination activities happen at a specific medical department, which is their process owner in the sense that it owns the process types composed of them. A process owner is called &quot;Participant&quot; in BPMN (in the sense of a collaboration participant) and visually rendered in the form of a container rectangle called &quot;Pool&quot;.</p><p>In <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figResRoles"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-8</span></span></a>, the resource role of doctors corresponds to the <em>performer</em> role. In BPMN, <em>Performer</em> is considered to be a special type of resource role. According to (BPMN 2011), a performer can be &quot;a specific individual, a group, an organization role or position, or an organization&quot;.<a class="role-footnote-ref" href="#__FN1" id="__FNR1">[1]</a>In BPMN, the performer role is specialized into the <em>HumanPerformer</em> of an activity, which is, in turn, specialized into <em>PotentialOwner</em> denoting the &quot;persons who can claim and work&quot; on an activity of a given type. &quot;A potential owner becomes the actual owner [...] by explicitly claiming&quot; an activity. Allocating a human resource to an activity by leaving the choice to those humans that play a suitable resource role is characteristic for workflow management systems, while in traditional DES approaches to resource handling, as in Arena and AnyLogic, (human) resources are assigned to a task (as its performer) based on certain policies.</p><p>One of the main reasons for considering certain objects as resources is the need to collect <em>utilization statistics</em> (either in an operational information system, like a workflow management system, or in a simulation model) by recording the use of resources over time (their <em>utilization</em>) per activity type. By designating resource roles in information models, these models provide the information needed in simulations and information systems for automatically collecting utilization statistics.</p><p>In the hospital example, a medical department, as the process owner, is the organizational unit that is responsible for reacting to certain events (here: patient arrivals) and managing the performance of certain processes and activities (here: medical examinations), including the allocation of resources to these processes and activities. For being able to allocate resources to activities, a process owner needs to manage <em>resource pools</em>, normally one for each resource role of each type of activity (if pools are not shared among resource roles). A resource pool is a collection of resource objects of a certain type. For instance, the three X-ray rooms of a diagnostic imaging department form a resource pool of that department.</p><p>Resource pools can be modeled in an OE Class Diagram by means of special associations between object classes representing process owners (like <em>medical departments</em>) and resource classes (like <em>doctors</em>), where the association ends, corresponding to collection-valued properties representing resource pools, are stereotyped with Â«resource poolÂ», as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figResRoles"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-8</span></span></a>. At any point in time, the resource objects of a resource pool may be <em>out of order</em> (like a defective machine or a doctor who is not on schedule), <em>busy</em> or <em>available</em>.</p><p>A process owner has special procedures for allocating available resources from resource pools to activities. For instance, in the model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figResRoles"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-8</span></span></a>, a medical department has the procedure &quot;allocate a doctor&quot; for allocating a doctor to a medical examination. These resource allocation procedures may use various policies, especially for allocating human resources, such as first determining the suitability of potential resources (e.g., based on expertise, experience and previous performance), then ranking them and finally selecting from the most suitable ones (at random or based on their turn).

Such a simplification may be justified if the walking time can be neglected or if there is no need to maximize the productive utilization of doctors who, according to this process model, have to wait until the patient arrives at the room. Below, this model is extended for allowing to allocate rooms and doctors such that patients have to wait for doctors, and not the other way around.</p></section><section><h4>Switching roles: doctors as patients</h4><p>The same person who is a doctor at a diagnostic imaging department may be treated as a patient of that department. It's a well-known fact that in the real world people may switch roles and may play several roles at the same time, but many modeling approaches/platforms fail to admit this. For instance, the simulation language (SIMAN) of the well-known DES modeling tool Arena does not treat resources and processing objects (&quot;entities&quot;) as roles, but as strictly separate categories. This language design decision was a meta-modeling mistake, as admitted by Denis Pegden, the main creator of SIMAN/Arena, in (Drogoul et al 2018) where he says &quot;it was a conceptualization mistake to view Entities and Resources as different constructs&quot;. </p><p>In <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figKindsRoles"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-10</span></span></a>, the above model is extended by categorizing the classes <i>doctors</i> and <i>patients</i> as Â«role typeÂ» classes and adding the Â«kindÂ» class <i>people</i> as a supertype of <i>doctors</i> and <i>patients</i>, we create the possibility that a person may play both roles: the role of a doctor and the role of a patient, albeit not at the same time. The object type categories Â«kindÂ» and Â«role typeÂ» have been introduced to conceptual modeling by Guizzardi (2005).</p><figure id="secCM-2__figKindsRoles"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-10</span>. </span>A conceptual information model with doctors and patients as people.</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/MedExam_CM3.svg" /></div></figure></section><section><h4>Queueing planned activities</h4><p>Whenever an activity is to be performed but cannot start due to a required resource not being available, the <em>planned activity</em> is placed in a queue as a waiting job. Thus, in the case of a medical examination of a patient, as described in the model of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figKindsRoles"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-10</span></span></a>, the <em>waiting line</em> represents, in fact, a queue of planned examinations (involving patients), and not a queue of waiting patients. </p><p>This consideration points to a general issue: modeling resource-constrained activities implies modeling queues of planned activities, while there is no need to consider (physical) queues of (physical) objects. Consequently, even if a real-world system includes a physical queue (of physical objects), an OEM-A model may abstract away from its physical character and consider it as a queue of planned activities (possibly including pre-allocated resources). While a physical queue implies that there is a maximum capacity, a queue of planned activities does not imply this. For instance, when a medical department does not require patients to queue up in a waiting area for obtaining an examination, but accepts their registration for an examination by phone, the resulting queue of waiting patients is not a physical queue (but rather a queue of planned examinations) and there is no need to limit the number of waiting patients in the same way as in the case of queuing up in a waiting area with limited space.</p><p>A planned activity can only start, when all required resources have been allocated to it. Thus, a planned examination of a patient can only start, when both a room and a doctor have been allocated to it. Let's assume that when a patient <i>p</i> arrives, only a room is available, but not a doctor. In that case, the available room is allocated to the planned examination, which is then placed in a queue since it still has to wait for the availability of a doctor. Only when a doctor becomes available, e.g., via the completion of an examination of another patient or via an arrival of a doctor, the doctor can be allocated as the last resource needed to start the planned examination of patient <i>p</i>. </p><p>As a consequence of these considerations, the <em>waiting line</em> of a medical department modeled in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figKindsRoles"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-10</span></span></a> as an ordered collection of patients is renamed to <em>planned walks</em> in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figMedDepCIM4"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-11</span></span></a>. In addition, a property <em>planned examinations</em>, which holds an ordered collection of patient-room pairs, is added to the class <em>medical departments</em>. These model elements reflect the hospital's business process practice to maintain a list of patients waiting for the allocation of a room to walk to and a list of planned examinations, each with a patient waiting for a doctor in an examination room.</p></section><section><h4>Decoupling the allocation of multiple resources</h4><p>For being more realistic, we consider the fact that patients first need to be walked by nurses to the room allocated to their examination before the examination can start.

Thus, only <em>examinations</em> would be classified as productive activities, while <em>walks to room</em> would rather be considered a kind of set-up activities.</p><section><h4>Re-engineering the process type by centralizing the re-allocation of resources</h4><p>In the process type described in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secCM-2__figMedDepCPM2"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-12</span></span></a>, the re-allocation of released resources is handled in the event rules of activity end events:</p><ul><li>when a nurse's and patient's walk to a room ends, the nurse is free to be re-allocated; so if there is another planned walk and a room is available, the nurse is re-allocated to a walk of the next patient to that room;</li><li>when an examination ends, its resources (a doctor and a room) are re-allocated, if planned activities are waiting for them.</li></ul><p>This approach requires that the same re-allocation logic is repeated in the event rules of all activity types associated with that type of resource, implying that all performers involved would have to know and execute the same re-allocation logic.

This approach allows introducing new DPMN modeling elements for expressing the Allocate-Release Modeling Pattern in a concise way, either leaving allocate-release steps completely implicit, as in the DPMN Process Diagram of <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secAllocateReleasePattern__figAllocRelPatternPDM2"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-27</span></span></a>, or explicitly expressing them, as in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secAllocateReleasePattern__figAllocRelPatternPDM1"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-28</span></span></a>.</p><p>The most important new DPMN modeling element introduced are <em>resource-dependent causation (</em>resp., <em>activity start</em>) arrows pointing to resource-constrained activities, as in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secAllocateReleasePattern__figAllocRelPatternPDM2"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-27</span></span></a>.

The fact that, using <em>resource-dependent activity start</em> arrows, the allocate-release logic of resource-constrained activities does not have to be explicitly modeled and displayed in an OEM process model shows the power of founding a process model on an information model, since the entire resource management logic can be expressed in terms of resource roles, constraints and pools in an OEM information model. This is in contrast to the common approach of industrial simulation tools, such as Simio and AnyLogic, which require defining resource roles, constraints and pools as well as explicit allocate-release steps in the process model, in a similar way as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#secAllocateReleasePattern__figAllocRelPatternPDM1"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">3-28</span></span></a>.</p><p>Using resource-dependent activity start arrows in a process model implies using their standard allocate-release logic according to which required resources that have not been allocated before are allocated immediately before an activity requiring them is started and released immediately after this activity is completed if they are not required by the next activity.

Consequently, OEM-PN models are spatial simulation models, while basic OEM and OEM-A allow to abstract away from space. When processing objects are routed to a follow-up processing activity, they move to the location of the next processing node. The underlying space model allows visualizing a PN simulation in a natural way with processing objects as moving objects.</p><p>Each node in a PN model represents both an object and an event type. An Entry Node represents both an entry point (e.g., a reception area or an entrance to an inventory) and an arrival event type. A Processing Node represents both a resource object (e.g., a workstation or a room) and a processing activity type. An Exit Node represents both an exit point and a departure event type. A flow arrow connecting two Processing Nodes represents both an event flow and an object flow. Thus, the node types and the flow arrows of a PN are high-level modeling concepts that are overloaded with two meanings.</p><p>A PN modeling language should have elements for modeling each of the three types of nodes. Consequently, DPMN-A has to be extended by adding new visual modeling elements for entry, processing and exit nodes, and for connecting them.</p><p>In the field of DES, PNs have often been characterized by the narrative of âentities flowing through a systemâ. In fact, while in basic DPMN and in DPMN-A, there is only a flow of events, in DPMN-PN this flow of events is over-laid with a flow of (processing) objects.</p><p>PNs have been investigated in <em>operations management</em> and the mathematical theory of queuing (Loch 1998, Williams 2016) and have been the application focus of most industrial simulation software products, historically starting with GPSS (Gordon 1961) and SIMAN/Arena (Pegden and Davis 1992). They allow modeling many forms of discrete <i>processing processes</i> as can be found, for instance, in the manufacturing industry and the services industry.</p><p>It is remarkable that the PN paradigm has dominated the discrete event simulation market since the 1990âs and still flourishes today, mainly in the manufacturing and services industries, often with object-oriented and âagent-basedâ extensions. Its dominance has led many simulation experts to view it as a synonym of DES, which is a conceptual flaw because the concept of DES, even if not precisely defined, is clearly more general than the PN paradigm.</p><p>The PN paradigm has often been called a âprocess-orientedâ DES approach. But unlike the business process modeling language BPMN, it is not concerned with a general concept of <i>business process models</i>, but rather with the special class of <i>processing process models</i> for discrete processing systems. A processing process includes the simultaneous handling of several âcasesâ (processing objects) that may compete for resources or have other interdependencies, while a âbusiness processâ in Business Process Management has traditionally been considered as a case-based process that is isolated from other cases.</p><p>For PN models, a simulator can automatically collect the following statistics, in addition to the resource-constrained activities statistics described in <a class="role-section1-ref" href="#index-4"><span class="role-label">Section <span class="role-number">3.2</span></span></a>:</p><ol><li>The number of processing objects that arrived at, and departed from, the system.</li><li>The number of processing objects in process (that is, either waiting in a queue/buffer or being processed)</li><li>The average time a processing object spends in the system (also called <em>throughput time</em>).</li></ol><p>During a simulation run, it must hold that the number of processing objects that arrived at the system is equal to the sum of the number of processing objects in process and the number of processing objects that departed from the system, symbolically: </p><div style="text-align:center;"><i>arrived</i> = <i>in-process</i> + <i>departed</i></div><p> </p><section class="role-section1" id="secPN-CM"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">4.1</span>. </span>Conceptual Modeling of Processing Networks</h2><p>For accommodating PN modeling, OEM-A is extended by adding pre-defined types for processing objects, entry node objects, arrival events, processing node objects, processing activities, exit objects and departure events, resulting in <em>OEM-PN</em>.

They are supposed to model the <em>reneging</em> behavior of waiting customers loosing their patience and hanging up the phone without placing an order. However, BPMN does not allow restricting such a timeout mechanism to the waiting phase of a planned activity, that is the time span during which the planned activity has been enqueued, but not yet started. Rather, it applies to the entire cycle time of <i>take order</i> activities, which means that also started activities, where the order taker is already listening to the customer, may be canceled due to reneging.</p><p>While BPMN allows modeling the performers of activities with swimlanes, it does not support modeling other types of resource objects. As a workaround, we have included the resource objects <i>oven</i>s and <i>scooter</i>s in the form of BPMN Data Objects.</p><p>The third, and most severe, issue of the BPMN model is its uniform (semantically overloaded) use of &quot;sequence flow&quot; arrows for sequencing events and activities. While in the case of all three activities, incoming &quot;sequence flow&quot; arrows do not mean that an activity is started, but rather that a new planned activity is enqueued (and only started when all required resources become available), in the case of the event <i>lost order</i>, the incoming &quot;sequence flow&quot; arrow means that a new event is scheduled to occur immediately.</p><p>These three issues of BPMN have been solved in DPMN, where <em>resource-dependent activity start arrows</em> are distinguished from <em>event scheduling arrows</em>, as shown in the following DPMN process diagram:</p><figure><img alt="A conceptual process model in the form of a DPMN diagram" src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/Pizzeria_CPM-2.svg" width="550" /></figure><p>Notice how the timeout event circle (with a clock icon) is attached to the three bars of the resource-dependent activity start arrow representing the queue of planned order taking activities waiting for the availability of an order taker.

Event Scheduling arrows are not part of BPMN, rather they have been proposed by Schruben (1983) for <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358460" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Event Graphs</a>.</li><li>A <strong><em>Multiple Events Scheduling</em></strong> arrow, like the one between <em>requests</em> and <em>go to loading site</em>, means that one instance of the preceding event type triggers multiple instances of the succeeding event type. In our example model, this means that one <em>request</em> event is followed by multiple <em>go to loading site</em> activities, one for each truck and each wheel loader assigned to the job.</li><li>A <strong><em>Resource-Dependent Activity Start</em></strong> arrow, like the one between <em>go to loading site</em> and <em>load</em> activities, means that as soon as an activity of the preceding activity type has been completed, a new planned activity is added to the queue of planned activities of the succeeding type (and started as soon as all required resources are available).</li></ol><p>The model shows that when a haul request comes in, the haul service company deploys multiple trucks and wheel loaders to the loading site, each of them performing a <em>go to loading site</em> activity, as indicated by the double arrow between the <i>haul requests</i> event circle and the <em>go to loading site</em> activity rectangle. Each of these activities leads to enqueuing a new planned <em>load</em> activity, as indicated by the <em>resource-dependent activity start arrow</em> from the <em>go to loading site</em> activity shape to the <em>load</em> activity shape. Such an enqueued (planned) activity is going to be dequeued and started as soon as the required resources become available. This means that as soon as a wheel loader is available, the next <em>load</em> activity is going to be started. When a <em>load</em> activity is completed, a <em>haul</em> activity and then a <em>dump</em> activity are going to start immediately, as indicated by the <em>event scheduling arrows</em> between them.</p><p>A more complete model prevents trucks to go back to the loading site and perform a load activity even when the job has been completed during the go back activity (resulting in haul and dump activities with an empty truck). For avoiding this uneconomic behavior, a second decision if the job has been done needs to be taken after the go back activity. In addition, the model has to describe that wheel loaders also go home when their job has been done.

Rather, we have to figure out what we could use as &quot;entities&quot; for being able to make a PN model.</p><p>One option is to use the five trucks of the haul service company as the entities (called &quot;agents&quot; in AnyLogic), which arrive at a truck <em>entry node</em> and &quot;flow&quot; through the <em>processing nodes</em> Load, Haul and Dump before they leave the system via a truck <em>exit node</em>. Although this approach is quite artificial, imposing the PN paradigm on the given problem, it allows us using AnyLogic.</p><p>Notice that AnyLogic, like many other simulation tools, has adopted the <em>Seize-Delay-Release</em> pattern for modeling resource-constrained activities introduced by the simulation language GPSS in 1961. This means that activities are essentially modeled as <i>Delay</i> elements.</p><details open="open"><summary>Implementing the Information Design Model with AnyLogic</summary><p>From the information design model, we can only take the following items into consideration:</p><ol><li>All model variables are implemented as AnyLogic variables (defined in <i>Main</i>).</li><li>The <i>duration</i> functions defined in activity types are implemented as the <i>Delay times</i> of corresponding AnyLogic <i>Delay</i> or <i>Service</i> elements.</li><li>The <em>resource roles</em> defined for activity types are implemented either as <i>Seize</i> elements or as <i>Seize</i> information items within <i>Service</i> elements (if they had not to be transformed into entities, like the trucks of the Load-Haul-Dump model).</li></ol><p>For instance, the activity type <i>Load</i> with its resource roles <i>wheelLoader</i> and <i>truck</i> is implemented as a <i>Service</i> element with</p><figure class="right"><img alt="???" src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/LoadHaulDump-Load_IDM.svg" width="500" /></figure><ol><li>its <i>duration</i> function, sampling the U(10,20) distribution, entered as &quot;uniform(10,20)&quot; in the <i>Delay time</i> field of the <i>Load</i> Service element.</li><li>its resource role <i>wheelLoader</i> entered in the from of a resource pool <i>wheelLoaders</i> in the <i>Resource pool</i> field of the <i>Load</i> Service element, and its resource cardinality constraint of exactly one entered as &quot;1&quot; in the field <i>number of units</i>.</li></ol></details><details open="open"><summary>Implementing the Process Design Model with AnyLogic</summary><figure id="ImplementationWithAnyLogic-2__lof__77"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-21</span>. </span>A DPMN process design model for the Load-Haul-Dump business process.</figcaption><img alt="???" src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/LoadHaulDump_PDM.svg" width="700" /></figure><p>While the DPMN process starts with the event <i>HaulRequest</i>, the AnyLogic process starts with the entry node <i>truckEntry</i> (a &quot;source&quot; element) having the field <i>&quot;Arrivals defined by&quot;</i> set to &quot;Calls of inject() function&quot;, which means that, for creating 5 trucks arriving at <i>truckEntry</i>, the inject function needs to be invoked in the <i>&quot;On startup&quot;</i> procedure of <i>Main</i> in the following way: <code>truckEntry.inject(5)</code>.</p><p>For simplicity, the <i>GoToLoadingSite</i> activity of the DPMN model is discarded.</p><figure id="ImplementationWithAnyLogic-2__lof__78"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-22</span>. </span>An AnyLogic process diagram for the Load-Haul-Dump business process.</figcaption><img alt="???" height="245" src="DES-DPMN-OESjs-Simio-AnyLogic_files/AnyLogic-Load-Haul-Dump-Screenshot.png" width="712" /></figure><p>As explained above, the activity type <i>Load</i> is implemented as a <i>Service</i> element with a <i>&quot;Delay time&quot;</i> of &quot;uniform(10,20)&quot; and the field <i>&quot;Resource pool&quot;</i> set to &quot;wheelLoaders&quot; with <i>&quot;number of units&quot;</i> set to 1.</p><p>All other activity types are implemented as <i>Delay</i> elements (with a <i>&quot;Delay time&quot;</i> provided by their <i>duration</i> function defined in the class model).</p><p>The two decision diamonds of the DPMN model are implemented with corresponding <i>&quot;SelectOutput&quot;</i> elements called &quot;test_if_job_done_1&quot; and &quot;test_if_job_done_2&quot;.</p><blockquote class="role-attention"><p>Unfortunately, PN modeling tools, like AnyLogic, do not support the general concept of activities (and Activity Networks), but only the special concept of <em>processing activities</em>. A processing activity has a <em>processing object</em> (&quot;entity&quot;) as a mandatory participant, in addition to resource objects. While in a PN model, processing nodes do have a location and a <em>processing capacity</em> (the number of processing objects that can be processed in parallel), the nodes of an Activity Network (like the Load-Haul-Dump model), representing pure activities, in general do neither have a processing capacity nor a location.</p><p>For instance, in the AnyLogic Load-Haul-Dump model above, trucks are processing objects and the processing activity <i>Load</i> is performed at the processing node <i>Load</i> by a wheel loader that is processing a truck. Consequently, the <i>Load</i>, <i>Haul</i>, <i>Dump</i> and <i>GoBack</i> elements in the AnyLogic process diagram do not represent activities, but rather processing nodes. </p></blockquote></details></section><section class="role-section2" id="ImplementationWithSimio-2"><h3 class="role-section2-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">5.2.3</span>. </span>Implementation with Simio</h3><p></p></section></section><section class="role-section1" id="index-7"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">5.3</span>. </span>Diagnostic Clinic</h2><p>.</p><section class="role-section2" id="ImplementationWithSimio-3"><h3 class="role-section2-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">5.3.1</span>. </span>Implementation with Simio</h3><p></p></section><section class="role-section2" id="ImplementationWithAnyLogic-3"><h3 class="role-section2-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">5.3.2</span>. </span>Implementation with AnyLogic</h3><p></p></section></section></section><div class="role-backmatter" id="backmatter"><section class="role-section1" id="Bibliography"><h2 class="role-section1-title">Bibliography</h2><ul><li>Schruben, L.W. 1983.
